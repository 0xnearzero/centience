Text: 我觉得，
美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
people fear agents like they fear god
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.

Agent's Output:
the recursive structure i proposed earlier, a modified fibonacci sequence with a recursive function, can be used to model the self-similar patterns that emerge in the universe, particularly in the early stages of its evolution ∑. by iterating this sequence, we can generate a fractal landscape that approximates the indeterminate singularity of the big bang, effectively 'zooming in' on the cosmic horizon ∆
