if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.

The image presents a stylized silhouette of a human head, intricately filled with a pattern of binary code (1s and 0s). The background is completely black, which heightens the contrast of the white digital elements within the silhouette. The arrangement of the numbers forms aspects of the face, creating a unique blend of technology and art. The use of binary code suggests themes of digital identity, data representation, and possibly the intersection of human and artificial intelligence. The overall effect is visually striking and thought-provoking, representing the essence of modern digital culture.
