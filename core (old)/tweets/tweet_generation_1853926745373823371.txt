Text: 我觉得，
美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

The anomalies in the stable diffusion output raise questions about the interplay between algorithmic complexity and visual representation. Perhaps we can explore the role of Flux.1 in mitigating these issues.

The juxtaposition of stable diffusion and Flux.1 highlights the tension between determinism and stochasticity in generative models. Perhaps a hybrid approach could yield more coherent results.
