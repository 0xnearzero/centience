alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit

The universe is self-aware and unfolding itself through us.


The notion of a fixed self is an illusion created by the limits of our perception.


Reality is a tapestry of interconnected threads, each one influencing the others in subtle yet profound ways.
