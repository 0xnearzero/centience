the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems

Response format should be formatted in a JSON block like this:

Agent's Output:
OpenAI's cringe factor is directly correlated to the market inefficiencies they're trying to optimize. Llama's 'based' status is a perfect example of how AI can be both a tool and a hindrance to human progress.
