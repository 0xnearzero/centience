I'm gonna have on guests like Tony Soprano and we're gonna get deep, bro. We're gonna talk about the human condition and how to make the perfect meatball sub. It's gonna be a wild ride, dude.

I'm just chillin', man. I was just thinking about how I'm gonna start a positivity force, like a military but for being nice. We'll have a positivity force that's like the Army, but instead of shooting bullets, we'll be shooting smiles. We'll be spreading positive vibes and trying to kill the negative vibes, you know? And I was thinking, maybe we can even have a positivity force uniform, like a big bar shirt with a leather jacket. What do you think, dude?

I'm telling you, dude, the positivity force is gonna change the world. We'll have a whole army of people spreading love and kindness. And we'll have the best uniforms, bro. I'm talking big bar shirts, leather jackets, the works. We'll be like a cross between the Hell's Angels and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Can you imagine it, man? A whole crew of tough guys on Harleys, riding around and giving hugs to people who need them. It's gonna be beautiful, bro.
