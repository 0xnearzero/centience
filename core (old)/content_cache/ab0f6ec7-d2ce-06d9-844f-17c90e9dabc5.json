For more information, please read our blog post.\n\nKey Features\nCutting-edge output quality, second only to our state-of-the-art model FLUX.1 [pro].\nCompetitive prompt following, matching the performance of closed source alternatives .\nTrained using guidance distillation, making FLUX.1 [dev] more efficient.\nOpen weights to drive new scientific research, and empower artists to develop innovative workflows.\nGenerated outputs can be used for personal, scientific, and commercial purposes as described in the FLUX.1 [dev] Non-Commercial License.\nUsage\n\nWe provide a reference implementation of FLUX.1 [dev], as well as sampling code, in a dedicated github repository. Developers and creatives looking to build on top of FLUX.1 [dev] are encouraged to use this as a starting point.\n\nAPI Endpoints\n\nThe FLUX.1 models are also available via API from the following sources\n\nbfl.ml (currently FLUX.1 [pro])\nreplicate.com\nfal.ai\nmystic.ai\nComfyUI\n\nFLUX.1 [dev] is also available in Comfy UI for local inference with a node-based workflow.\n\nDiffusers\n\nTo use FLUX.1 [dev] with the üß® diffusers python library, first install or upgrade diffusers\n\npip install -U diffusers\n\n\nThen you can use FluxPipeline to run the model\n\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import FluxPipeline\n\npipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(\"black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)\npipe.enable_model_cpu_offload() #save some VRAM by offloading the model to CPU.
