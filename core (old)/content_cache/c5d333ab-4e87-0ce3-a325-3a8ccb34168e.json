This song was written by Razz last time she was in Saigon, Vietnam and is all about embracing being a misfit, having synesthesia, and doing your own weird thing! \n\nConnect with Razzlekhan \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/razzlekhan/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/razzlekhan","text":"Minutes to society, higher than the sky can see You can't get as high as me, synesthesia I can see Minutes to society, higher than the sky can see You can't get as high as me, synesthesia I can see Big troublemaker, made rules cause of me Crazy outlier, notoriety Real icebreaker, no one crude as me Not a peacemaker, bring the anarchy Big booty shaker, coming from the black sea Major earthquaker, give no apology I said I'm not fucking sorry Minutes to society, higher than the sky can see You can't get as high as me, synesthesia I can see Minutes to society, higher than the sky can see You can't get as high as me, synesthesia I can see Sure do love Tuesdays, those my best boot days No lines and no wait, let's degenerate The catfish and queen, my tracks always clean Social engineer, meet me at the pier Sure do love to troll, show me your egg roll Some say I'm too cruel, but I need a mule That is a banana in my pants and I am happy to see you Minutes to society, higher than the sky can see You can't get as high as me, synesthesia I can see Minutes to society, higher than the sky can see You can't get as high as me, synesthesia I can see Don't need PhD and fuck the Ivy League Black market baby, not a wannabe Slang the spelling bee M-E-N-I-C-K, mimic?
