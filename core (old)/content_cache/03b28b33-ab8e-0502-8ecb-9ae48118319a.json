It can be accessed through a CumeSlab (a now-discontinued beta device, but most channels still work), a CumeVision headset, or an intracranial implant. Most viewers use the CumeVision, as it is the most all-around accessible and engrossing experience.\n\nSociety and culture\n\nDue to rising temperatures and dangerous outdoor conditions, most people must stay indoors. Therefore, CumeTV, a cheap, stationary activity, is the most popular global pastime. It exerts such a huge influence on culture, it is in essence the only culture now generated.\n\nNotable figures\n\nSomeone - founder\n\nCumin McKinney - creative director\n\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nCumeTV Wiki is a FANDOM Lifestyle Community.\nVIEW MOBILE SITE\nFollow on IG\nTikTok\nJoin Fan Lab\nCheck out Fandom\nSearch this wiki\nSearch all wikis"}}
