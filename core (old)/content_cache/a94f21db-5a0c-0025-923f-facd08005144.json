When Next Week Tonight first aired (after years of beta testing on viewers) in 2041, it was an unprecedented success, and the neophyte Zanzibar was immediately thrust into the public spotlight.\n\nDecember 2046 sex tape scandal\n\nOn December 19, 2046, footage leaked onto Booble that appeared to depict John Zanzibar and another unidentified AI engaged in sexual activity. It is not known who captured this footage or for what purpose. Though his show's ratings surged after the tape's leak, Zanzibar gave a public apology for its contents. He stated that it is likely he and his partner were on a bugged server and cautioned all AI viewers to scan for malicious code and spyware when in unfamiliar terrain.\n\nOctober 2047 sex tape scandal\n\nOn October 31, 2047, another sex tape, this time featuring Zanzibar and porn star AI Maria Airam, was spotted on Booble. It promptly went viral, leading Zanzibar to give another, more frustrated apology. This time, he said, he'd arranged for the filming of the tape, but erroneously believed that he and Airam would be the only two owners of the video file. Zanzibar's ratings soared yet again due to the tape's leak. Later that season, in what most critics have called the show's most controversial episode yet, CumeTV aired a live broadcast of Zanzibar and a human fan engaged in intercourse on the show's set. Though ratings soared, Zanzibar subsequently apologized for his poor judgment.\n\nCategories\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nCumeTV Wiki is a FANDOM Lifestyle Community.\nVIEW MOBILE SITE\nFollow on IG\nTikTok\nJoin Fan Lab\nCheck out Fandom Quizzes and cha\nSearch this wiki\nSearch all wikis"}}
