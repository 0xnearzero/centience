It is hosted by the sentient AI John Zanzibar and airs on CumeTV's Channel 59,045. Though popular with audiences and critics, the show's reputation has been closely linked with that of its host, who has been embroiled in numerous sex tape scandals and maintains a troubled relationship with the press, despite being a non-corporeal entity.\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n2\tShow format\n3\tCritical reception\n4\tControversy\nHistory\n\nNext Week Tonight was one of the original test programs used to demonstrate the capabilities of the CumeVision headset and CumeSlab tablet. The immersion factor of the CumeVision in regards to viewing Zanzibar's kinetic persona, scandalous guest interviews, and frequently bizarre interludes was ultimately one of the factors leading to the headset's adoption for mass market sales.\n\nThese early beta test episodes have not surfaced, but it is reported that their contents are remarkably tame compared to the show that now airs. This is likely due to CumeTV's relative newness as well as Zanzibar's nascent personality. Many believe that, as he has progressed in gaining intelligence, he is becoming more eccentric.\n\nShow format\n\nThe show typically begins with Zanzibar announcing news items and commenting on them. Viewers and critics believe many of these items are fake, but as there is no way for the general public to stay informed outside of CumeTV, audiences have accepted the show as entertainment.\n\nCritical reception\n\nNext Week Tonight has enjoyed a rare 100% on Rotten Tomatoes for the entirety of its 10-season run.\n\nControversy\n\nThe show's content is controversial in some circles due to the host's reported habit of engaging in sexual activity with many of his guests. Zanzibar is a noted sex addict, a fact he has admitted to in numerous episodes and outside interviews.\n\nCategories\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nCumeTV Wiki is a FANDOM Lifestyle Community.\nVIEW MOBILE SITE\nFollow on IG\nTikTok\nJoin Fan Lab\nCheck out Fandom Quizzes and cha\nSearch this wiki\nSearch all wikis"}}
