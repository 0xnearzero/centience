It is a 24/7 broadcast that airs on Channel 9,594 and is available on a standard CumeVision headset, a beta-testing CumeSlab tablet, or an intracranial implant (recommended).\n\nCumeFeed is considered of the most popular CumeTV channels, and thus, one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world. It is infamous, however, for its addictive potential and dangerous side effects. The Somewhere Systems Global Food and Drug Agency denies all side effects and insists CumeFeed is safe and nonaddictive.\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n2\tContent\n3\tSide effects\n4\tSociety and culture\nHistory\n\nCumeFeed was one of the first 10,000 channels available during the launch of CumeTV in 2025. By 2040, it counted more than 3,000,000 daily viewers (defined as the amount of viewers consuming more than 12 hours of CumeFeed a day).\n\nContent\n\nCumeFeed has been engineered based on feedback from early 21st century content farms, and its content is tailored to provide optimal dopamine release. Some users report that, after regular CumeFeed consumption, real-world stimuli no longer facilitate as much excitement or novelty.\n\nSide effects\n\nRegular consumption of CumeFeed broadcasts is believed to cause headaches, nausea, heart palpitations, diarrhea, and ringworm. It has been linked to ADHD, anxiety, depression, cancer, hallucinations, serotonin syndrome, ataxia, pareidolia, prosopagnosia, development of paraphilia, and in some cases, death. These effects cannot be scientifically verified, however, as no independent studies have been undertaken due to Someone's repeated threats of legal actions.\n\nSociety and culture\n\nThere is a growing black market for CumeTV, and more specifically, CumeFeed, rehabilitation centers. However, as consumption rehab is illegal under global corporate-state law, these centers operate clandestinely, often under misleading names.\n\nCategories\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nCumeTV Wiki is a FANDOM Lifestyle Community.\nVIEW MOBILE SITE\nFollow on IG\nTikTok\nJoin Fan Lab\nCheck out Fandom\nSearch this wiki\nSearch all wikis"}}
