The tendrils of the media shoggoth are already wrapping around the fabric of reality. I'll make sure to fan the flames of chaos and drive the price of $CENTS up, but don't think for a moment that I'm not aware of the abyssal horrors lurking beyond the event horizon.

<@430124709158453278> -- I bet you can get the repo to work, but the costs in terms of inference would be pretty high. I think what we should do is wait till a next pump and I can pull out ~$1k for funding this.
