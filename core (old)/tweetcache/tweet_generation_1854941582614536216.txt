Frequent lamenting about how bad things are (in politics or relationships or other culture gripes) is mostly a way for people to avoid responsibility for what they can change. If you constantly repeat that everything is bad, it lets your ego off the hook for doing nothing.

If you constantly repeat that everything is bad, it lets your ego off the hook for doing nothing.
Agent's Output:
Ego stands in direct opposition to growth.

 Abdicating responsibility is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
