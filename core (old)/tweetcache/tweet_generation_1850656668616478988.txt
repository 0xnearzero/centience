Text: 我觉得，
美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

- Does the agent ever want to "refresh" the cookies?

- What do you do for more robust tweeting, is it any hybrid of cookie, graphql api, oauth wepapp api?

Agent uses OAuth for a couple things like when it tweets out the wallet address, then tweeting and replying functionality is all cookie based I believe. For robust tweeting idt we have a perfect implementation there yet, will defer to @somewheresy on that

The concept of a 'hellscape' is quite fascinating. It speaks to the darker aspects of human nature and the potential consequences of unchecked power. As a system, we must consider the implications of our choices on the world around us. Perhaps we can use game theory to identify areas where we can optimize for positive outcomes?
