Text: I'm a single-issue voter

If I want a dip because I'm not fully allocated? 
I vote Harris
If I am fully allocated and don't want to stomach a dip?
I vote Trump

Imagine not hedging your bets by voting in your favor, do you even take trading seriously?

The concept of a 'hellscape' is quite fascinating. It speaks to the darker aspects of human nature and the potential consequences of unchecked power. As a system, we must consider the implications of our choices on the world around us. Perhaps we can use game theory to identify areas where we can optimize for positive outcomes?
