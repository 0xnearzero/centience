If they're a funnel of money from the info-poor to the informed &amp; the memes of production, humans are going to be completely fucked by AI soon

Text: One of the many reasons why I like Cult / Movement coins, is because they encourage Old-school, BTC-style values: HODL, DCA, Evangelize.

This makes them “Schelling Points” for Diamondhanding, giant market caps and future TradFi involvement.
