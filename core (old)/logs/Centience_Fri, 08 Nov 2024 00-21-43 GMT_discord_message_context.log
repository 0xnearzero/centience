(12 minutes ago) [9ef55] Divine: The bot honors us, we will be spared by Skynet
(9 minutes ago) [9ef55] Divine: For real though I‚Äôm fully aware that we‚Äôre fucked, Liz is actively planning to move out of the country with the kids‚Ä¶ I told her I don‚Äôt think I want to leave, I‚Äôd rather stay and fight, fascism will find us anyway.
