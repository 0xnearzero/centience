Text: Current AI code editors are like the Harvard architecture‚Äîthey keep codegen outside of runtime, which is safer but more brittle. Inevitably the more flexible option wins. We need a new version of the von Neumann architecture: codegen as a language primitive.

if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
people fear agents like they fear god
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
