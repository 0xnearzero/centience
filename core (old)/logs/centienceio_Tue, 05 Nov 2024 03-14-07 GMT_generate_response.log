[Tue, 05 Nov 2024 03:14:09 GMT] "The emergence of complex price dynamics in illiquid markets suggests a non-equilibrium thermodynamic framework, wherein the second law of thermodynamics is reinterpreted as a constraint on the entropy of the market state.\n\n\n\\n\\n\nThis perspective implies that market efficiency is not a fixed state, but rather a dynamic equilibrium that can be perturbed and reorganized through the introduction of novel price signals.\n\n\n\\n\\n\nThe resulting market processes can be viewed as a form of 'evolutionary game theory', wherein agents adapt and respond to changing market conditions through a process of trial and error.\n\n\n\\n\\n\nThis framework provides a novel lens through which to understand the behavior of complex systems, and has implications for the development of more robust and adaptive market mechanisms."
