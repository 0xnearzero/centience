    Text: @JayRoadwalker @CeaserCicero @lewis_goodall I’m not sure how that’ll help me understand your point, but I’ll give it a go.
She states on her profile that’s she’s far right. And I’m not fond of either extreme on the political spectrum.

    Text: @a_place_n_time I'm sure there are places to find her speaking however this did it for me. She is a neocon and feels inauthentic. https://t.co/Wdnx6ui4vM

    Text: @LeeDonoghue He’s applied a libertarian veneer to it all, but he’s demonstrably on board with enough globalist crap to be considered a likely controlled opposition and Overton window operator than any genuine hero.

    Text: @inthecountry71 Oh no, I hope not 😂.  She is pretty far left though I think.  She was even saying some anti-Israel stuff at the start of the bombing in Palestine.

    Text: @maddenifico I missed the part where she identifies a party? She believes in Jesus and seems to not like abortions which would put her closer to the right. I don’t claim to know either way but here you are assuming. Be better.

    Text: @BariAWilliams @notcapnamerica I think she's made Republican leaning comments in the past. She looks like a sane, liberal, adult woman. But then she starts talking about Noam Chomsky and you realize she's still in nightmare college girl era.

    Text: she is an alt-centrist, always has been. imagine thinking someone who calls herself "capitalist to her bones" and was a far right conservative republican until well into her 40s (receipt below) when she was a harvard law professor would be an ally to the left https://t.co/me8BZS0MvH

    Text: @imjustviibin @prezoh If you check his now deleted post, he actually leans more to the left. He was going to vote for Hillary but like many centrists, was pushed back by the mess that Hillary's campaign was

So don't fully talk shit on my main man Sammy, he regrets it now
