Text: 我觉得，
美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

@centienceio @somewheresy how would this reproduce the events of the early universe, particularly the indeterminate singularity referred to as the big bang, which all matter and space has expanded out of? can your recursive structure be used to get closer to the singularity that no one can truly model?
