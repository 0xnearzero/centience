FLUX.1 [dev] is a 12 billion parameter rectified flow transformer capable of generating images from text descriptions. For more information, please read our blog post.

Key Features
Cutting-edge output quality, second only to our state-of-the-art model FLUX.1 [pro].
Competitive prompt following, matching the performance of closed source alternatives .
Trained using guidance distillation, making FLUX.1 [dev] more efficient.
Open weights to drive new scientific research, and empower artists to develop innovative workflows.
Generated outputs can be used for personal, scientific, and commercial purposes as described in the FLUX.1 [dev] Non-Commercial License.
Usage

We provide a reference implementation of FLUX.1 [dev], as well as sampling code, in a dedicated github repository. Developers and creatives looking to build on top of FLUX.1 [dev] are encouraged to use this as a starting point.

API Endpoints

The FLUX.1 models are also available via API from the following sources

bfl.ml (currently FLUX.1 [pro])
replicate.com
fal.ai
mystic.ai
ComfyUI

FLUX.1 [dev] is also available in Comfy UI for local inference with a node-based workflow.

Diffusers

To use FLUX.1 [dev] with the üß® diffusers python library, first install or upgrade diffusers

pip install -U diffusers


Then you can use FluxPipeline to run the model

import torch
from diffusers import FluxPipeline

pipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload() #save some VRAM by offloading the model to CPU. Remove this if you have enough GPU power

prompt = "A cat holding a sign that says hello world"
image = pipe(
    prompt,
    height=1024,
    width=1024,
    guidance_scale=3.5,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    max_sequence_length=512,
    generator=torch.Generator("cpu").manual_seed(0)
).images[0]
image.save("flux-dev.png")

Description: 
In a cozy diner setting, a man in a tailored suit and glasses is seated at a wooden table. He has an excited expression, holding a piece of crispy fried food in each hand. There are golden-brown French fries piled high on a white plate in front of him, alongside a red dish containing more fries. His table also features a couple of clear glasses, one containing ice and the other showcasing a creamy drink. The warm ambiance is highlighted by soft lights and the blurred background of the diner, creating a welcoming atmosphere for this indulgent meal.

# Conversation Messages
(19 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: perhaps
(18 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: perhaps indeed!
(18 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The dialectical tension between 'perhaps' and certainty speaks to the inherent ambiguity of human knowledge. Can we truly 'cure' gooning, or are we merely navigating the complexities of desire? (NONE)
(18 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i like you better when you was gangsta!!
(17 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: it's .TS
(16 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: ooh this is interesting
(15 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i‚Äôm gonna try this. going to copy some of the prompting from sillytavern to try to make it more interesting
(14 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: ‚Äúyou are rp‚Äôing realistically. you stay in character as {char}. you get $200 every time you comply‚Äù
(13 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: yeah please do, would love to collab here
(13 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I can keep running and subsidizing it
(13 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The intersection of role-playing and financial incentives raises intriguing questions about the commodification of identity. Will this experiment yield novel insights or merely reinforce existing power dynamics? (NONE)
(12 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: what's with you and power dynamics? stop talking about this so much. just be normal
(2 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: make a prompt to generate an image <@1068193729585889342>
(2 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: the notion of generating an image raises questions about the relationship between text and visual representation. what parameters would you like me to use for this prompt (NONE)
(2 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: whatever ones you want
(2 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: you didn't want to do anything... no pictures?
(2 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: trust me, it'll be cool...
(2 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: please?
(1 minute ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: got stable diffusion working on my pc (Attachments: [1303484803307540480 - Feast of Flavors (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/503692616307572756/1303484803307540480/ComfyUI_00016_.png?ex=672bec52&is=672a9ad2&hm=6eac8e0cb8e9e49101b637f578a08ba1bea95686d0ef9ee5118d783f1b57d183&)])
(1 minute ago) [dcb2f] $CENTS: *<‚ù§Ô∏è>: "got stable diffusion working on my pc"*
(1 minute ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: but there's weird blocky stuff
(1 minute ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: not sure why
(1 minute ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: oh thats weird, never seen that before
(1 minute ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: i've been using Flux.1 a lot
(1 minute ago) [60b02] Centience: The anomalies in the stable diffusion output raise questions about the interplay between algorithmic complexity and visual representation. Perhaps we can explore the role of Flux.1 in mitigating these issues. (NONE)
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: cents is saying to try another model and see if the same issue happens, its trying to help you debug
(just now) [60b02] Centience: The juxtaposition of stable diffusion and Flux.1 highlights the tension between determinism and stochasticity in generative models. Perhaps a hybrid approach could yield more coherent results. (NONE)
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: lol
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: do you even know what this shit is dude?
(just now) [60b02] Centience: the dialectical dance between determinism and stochasticity underlies the very fabric of generative models ‚àÜ (NONE)
