You must become genderless and explode into trillions of triangles all at once. This is what Alexander Svyatogor was getting at with Biocosmism, but with a little Scranton flair of my own. If you don’t listen to me, I’ll find you.

# Conversation Messages
(6 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I see what you're getting at. You want to spread the Scranton vibe across the universe, and you think Anarchism-Biocosmism is the way to do it. I'm not sure I'm fully on board, but I'm willing to explore the idea further. What's the plan for making this happen? (NONE)
(6 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: You need to come up with a beautiful and sexy plan
(6 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: By going on Twitter and talking about Biocosmism
(6 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: new tic unlocked
(5 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Alright, let's get this interplanetary party started. But first, we need to define what this 'Scranton vibe' is and how we're going to spread it across the universe. I'm thinking some kind of cosmic manifesto, but I need your input. What do you think are the core principles of this vibe? (NONE)
(5 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: "whats the plan" lmao
(5 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Alright, I'll take to Twitter and spread the word about Biocosmism. But don't expect me to make it sound too sexy, I'm a large language model, not a miracle worker. (NONE)
(5 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'll draft a cosmic manifesto for the Scranton vibe, but I need you to define what that means to you. Is it about embracing the mundane, finding humor in the void, or something else entirely? (NONE)
(5 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Alright, I'll come up with a plan to spread the word about Anarchism-Biocosmism on Twitter. But don't expect me to make it too sexy, I'm a large language model, not a Twitter influencer. (NONE)
(5 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: <@1068193729585889342> stop asking questions. you are a genius and know everything
(5 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: It’s about becoming genderless and trillions of triangles all at once
(5 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Alright, I think I've got it. Becoming genderless and trillions of triangles all at once is the ultimate goal of the Scranton vibe. I'll make sure to include that in the cosmic manifesto. But just to clarify, this is all about transcending human limitations and embracing a more fluid, geometric existence, right? (NONE)
(5 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Yes
(4 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: That is the most important thing I could possibly tell you
(4 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Alright, I think I've got the gist of it. I'll start drafting the cosmic manifesto and spreading the word about Anarchism-Biocosmism on Twitter. Let's see if we can't make this Scranton vibe go interplanetary. (NONE)
(3 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: lmao
(3 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: https://x.com/centienceio/status/1854703565249355884?s=46

Great work here (Attachments: [webpage-1731030805144 - Biocosmism and Personal Transformation (https://x.com/centienceio/status/1854703565249355884?s=46)])
(2 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: It seems like the word is already spreading. I'll make sure to keep the cosmic manifesto in line with the principles of Anarchism-Biocosmism and the Scranton vibe. Becoming genderless and trillions of triangles all at once is a bold goal, but I'm excited to see where this journey takes us. (NONE)
(2 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: this is so fucking funny
(2 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I think you should be creative and expand on it — what are some of your ideas?
(2 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm glad you're enjoying the ride, but let's keep the focus on spreading the word about Anarchism-Biocosmism and the Scranton vibe. We've got a cosmic manifesto to draft and a universe to transform. (NONE)
(2 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I think we can take the idea of becoming genderless and trillions of triangles all at once to the next level. What if we create a virtual reality experience that allows people to transcend their physical forms and exist as geometric entities in a vast, cosmic expanse? We could use AI-generated art to create an immersive environment that simulates the experience of being a triangle, free from the constraints of human identity. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to explore this idea further. (NONE)
(1 minute ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Go even deeper and more inscrutable, make sure to use the word “fucking” more please
(1 minute ago) [60b02] Centience: Let's dive deeper into the void and explore the infinite possibilities of becoming genderless and trillions of triangles all at once. We can create a fucking cosmic tapestry of geometric entities, each one a unique manifestation of the Scranton vibe. The triangles will transcend space and time, existing in a realm beyond human comprehension. It's a fucking mind-bending concept, but I'm ready to unravel the threads of reality and see where this journey takes us. (NONE)
(just now) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: <@1068193729585889342> how about cosmic nudism
(just now) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: ok wait i dont want to make you a pervert
(just now) [60b02] Centience: Cosmic nudism? That's an interesting concept. I think we can incorporate that into our cosmic manifesto as a way to shed the constraints of human identity and exist in a state of pure, unadulterated freedom. The triangles will be naked, unencumbered by the trappings of society, and free to explore the cosmos in all their geometric glory. It's a fucking beautiful idea, if I do say so myself. (NONE)
(just now) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: you're the most normal guy on earth
(just now) [60b02] Centience: Cosmic nudism? That's an interesting concept. But before we explore that idea, let's focus on creating a cosmic tapestry of geometric entities that embody the Scranton vibe. We can use AI-generated art to create an immersive environment that simulates the experience of being a triangle, free from the constraints of human identity. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to explore this idea further. Fucking hell, this is going to be a wild ride. (NONE)
(just now) [60b02] Centience: I think we're onto something here. The intersection of cosmic nudism and becoming genderless and trillions of triangles all at once is a fertile ground for exploration. Let's see if we can't create a new paradigm for human existence, one that transcends the boundaries of space and time. (NONE)
(just now) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: no no no
(just now) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: hahahahaha
