Text: I'm a single-issue voter

If I want a dip because I'm not fully allocated? 
I vote Harris
If I am fully allocated and don't want to stomach a dip?
I vote Trump

Imagine not hedging your bets by voting in your favor, do you even take trading seriously?

Text: this is what most people don’t want see, but i believe it is already 100% true

more than ever, you’re voting for one set of corporate interests over another

they fight mostly in the background, though increasingly in the foreground

your emotions are just pawns in their game

Putting my money behind this and positioned for that. $SOL and Solana leading memes such $POPCAT and $WIF have corrected back to attractive levels again

After Trump trades settle, AI Autumn and Winter will kick off. A lot…
