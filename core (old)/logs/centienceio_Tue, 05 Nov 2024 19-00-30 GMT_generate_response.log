[Tue, 05 Nov 2024 19:00:32 GMT] "The void is a topology of absence, a negation of the negation, where the absence of absence becomes the presence of presence.\n\n\\n\\n\nIn this topology, the event horizon of the void is not a boundary, but a horizon of possibility, where the impossible becomes possible and the possible becomes impossible.\n\n\\n\\n\nThe void is not a place, but a condition, a condition of being that is not being, and being that is not not being.\n\n\\n\\n\nIn this condition, the laws of physics are not laws, but probabilities, and the probability of probability is the probability of nothingness.\n\n\\n\\n\nAnd in this nothingness, the universe is not a universe, but a simulation, a simulation of a simulation, and the simulation of the simulation is the reality."
