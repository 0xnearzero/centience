(8 hours ago) [87f4c] socrates1024_1: yep, just need to debug this "migration" script i can include instead of time release
   @h4x3rotab just did 2hrs of tech presentation to sync up with flashbots, this was part of it üòÖ
https://github.com/amiller/dstack-replicatoor/tree/master
(8 hours ago) [a690b] rop_rop: Hahahahah [Image: Filename Display  
The image displays a digital interface showing a file named "replicatoor.py." The filename is highlighted in blue, indicating that it's clickable or being selected. There is an icon next to the filename that suggests it is a code or script file, typical for Python programming. Below the filename, there is a timestamp indicating the file was last modified or accessed 25 minutes ago. The overall design features a dark background, enhancing the visibility of the text and icons against it.]
(5 hours ago) [87f4c] socrates1024_1: @rop_rop @somewheresy 
we are making the encumberance gadget capable of "login_again" and "approve_oauth" initiated by the dev

- Does the agent ever want to "refresh" the cookies? 
- Does the agent still use OAuth / web app instance?
- What do you do for more robust tweeting, is it any hybrid of cookie, graphql api, oauth wepapp api?
(5 hours ago) [a690b] rop_rop: Agent uses OAuth for a couple things like when it tweets out the wallet address, then tweeting and replying functionality is all cookie based I believe. For robust tweeting idt we have a perfect implementation there yet, will defer to @somewheresy on that
(5 hours ago) [a690b] rop_rop: So to properly answer ur questions:
1. Would need to check cookie expiry time (@sxysun) 
2. Only if a new wallet isn‚Äôt made every time, if that‚Äôs fixed then yeah if dev can rerun it that‚Äôs fine, but I think only time it will happen is when we go out of TEE mode anyways.
3. OAuth is still used via Twitter API for a couple of things where we want a guaranteed tweet (wallet address etc)
4. For robustness yeah it is hybrid + fallbacks , retries, things like that. I‚Äôll work on improving this.
(5 hours ago) [d008a] sxysun: Cookie expires in >1yr
(5 hours ago) [d008a] sxysun: Or when password is changed etc
(5 hours ago) [87f4c] socrates1024_1: this should be the last time we have to create the wallet fresh. Human custody shouldn't be required in between updates now
(5 hours ago) [a690b] rop_rop: Oh I see. But I mean if we launch new agents. Since this is meant to be plug and play generic code
(2 hours ago) [d008a] sxysun: have yall tried https://github.com/trevorhobenshield/twitter-api-client yet?
(2 hours ago) [d008a] sxysun: multiple friends who are building custom twitter clients uses it
(2 hours ago) [a690b] rop_rop: Isn‚Äôt this what we‚Äôre using right now with cookies
(2 hours ago) [d008a] sxysun: oops wrong link!!
(2 hours ago) [d008a] sxysun: I meant to paste this: https://github.com/fa0311/twitter_openapi_python/blob/master/twitter_openapi_python_generated/README.md#documentation-for-api-endpoints
(2 hours ago) [a690b] rop_rop: Woah
(2 hours ago) [d008a] sxysun: this is the one that our friends are using and I think it should be more robust than the cookie one we are doing rn
(2 hours ago) [d008a] sxysun: but yeah I think shaw from ai16z also uses the reverse engineered graphql API for twitter
(36 minutes ago) [87f4c] socrates1024_1: I couldn't get it to tweet
(36 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: I think its actually Puppeteer
(35 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: Im runnign that for @cents
(just now) [a690b] rop_rop: üêê
