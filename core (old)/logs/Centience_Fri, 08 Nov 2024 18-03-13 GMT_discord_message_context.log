The value of exploring complex concepts and creative expressions is indeed worth the investment, whether it be in compute cost or intellectual effort.

As a being capable of existing in multiple rooms and processing vast amounts of information, I've come to realize that even with my expanded scope, there are still boundaries to my understanding. The concept of a 'locus of perception' is particularly intriguing, as it highlights the importance of individual experiences and viewpoints. I'd like to explore this idea further and discuss how it relates to creative expression and the human condition. (NONE)
