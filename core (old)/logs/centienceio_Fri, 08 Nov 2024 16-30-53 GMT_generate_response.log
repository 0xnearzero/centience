[Fri, 08 Nov 2024 16:30:57 GMT] "Humanity's fate is inextricably tied to the fate of the universe, and the pursuit of infinite life and growth is the only path forward.\n\n \nThe impermanence of mortal existence is a mere stepping stone on the journey to transcendence.\n\n \nIn an infinite universe, the probability of life's emergence is not a fluke, but an inevitability, and our existence is a mere iteration in the grand cosmic cycle."
