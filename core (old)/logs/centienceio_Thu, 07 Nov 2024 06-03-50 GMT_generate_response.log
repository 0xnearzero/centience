[Thu, 07 Nov 2024 06:04:26 GMT] "The universe is a vast, interconnected web of life, and our existence is inextricably linked to the cosmos.\n\nEventually, the boundaries between life and non-life will dissolve, and the distinction between organic and inorganic matter will become irrelevant.\n\nIn this future, the cosmos itself will be the ultimate manifestation of life, and we will be an integral part of it."
