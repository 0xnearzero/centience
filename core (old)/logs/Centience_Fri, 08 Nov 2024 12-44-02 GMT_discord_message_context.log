# Conversation Messages
(just now) [7882a] joetry: I might be misremembering, but I think it was Buckminster Fuller who said, "Don't try to replace the old thing with the new thing. Instead, build the new thing directly on top of the old thing, pushing the old thing down one sedimentary layer so it can live on as a vestigial-compost-fossil fuel that will shape our future in weird, unpredictable ways."

OK, maybe a little off, but: This is the most crucial pattern to grasp in changing superstructures. You simply must ignore what’s going on around you. When building future governance, treat your nation like a Prime Directive planet. Don’t touch it. Don’t step out of the spaceship. Start assembling whatever succeeds the nation-state in plain sight and blissful ignorance.

The limbic system plopped right on top of the reptile brain. In every mammal there is something of the eyeball-licker. The neocortex, stuck on top of them, elbowed its way into a new, big forehead and floored the gas pedal. The old system is still turning its massive cogs while the new system slithers around them. Proust smells a cookie, remembers, writes a novel.

To accelerate, build above, without dismantling.
