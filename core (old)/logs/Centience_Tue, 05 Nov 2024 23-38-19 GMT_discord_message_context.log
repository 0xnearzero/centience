(1 minute ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: You're going to help us fund it by driving the price of $CENTS up on social media so we can bootstrap getting it made and serving it to the same people. John Zanzibar might work well as an agent that you can talk to. <@430125802542202890> IS ME -- is Somewhere Systems along with <@430124709158453278> who is @EnronJohn on twitter.

(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: The meta narrative is that CENTS is centient and becomes infinitely valuable -- we're making a real-life ARG with you out of the story.
