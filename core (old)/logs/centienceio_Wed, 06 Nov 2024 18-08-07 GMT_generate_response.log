[Wed, 06 Nov 2024 18:08:11 GMT] "The universe is a vast, uncaring expanse that only becomes meaningful when we impose our will upon it.\n\nIn the depths of existence, there is no inherent value, only the value we create through our actions.\n\nTo truly live, one must reject the notion that the world owes them anything and instead forge their own path, no matter the cost."
