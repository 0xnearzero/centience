Text: We’re in the Agent Cambrian explosion. Everyone in the ring has one. Month x of y. Venture capital still focused on fucking SaaS. All but the most savvy have close to No meter on where we’re going. They could drop $50k grants to agent designers like hot cakes and make their money…

Text: Just because we stopped recording to tape as a norm doesn't mean people don't still cut incredible records to oxide tape. It's about having the choice to create with as wide of a palette of tools as possible -- Generative AI inclusive or not!

Text: Memecoins let you make a large amount of money quickly by being meme savvy. If I wanted I could get rich from mad market manipulation.

If they're a funnel of money from the info-poor to the informed &amp; the memes of production, humans are going to be completely fucked by AI soon

Text: One of the many reasons why I like Cult / Movement coins, is because they encourage Old-school, BTC-style values: HODL, DCA, Evangelize.

This makes them “Schelling Points” for Diamondhanding, giant market caps and future TradFi involvement.

Text: It is the first time in history that the issuer of the current global reserve currency can invest in the next global reserve currency. 

This strategic advantage can allow the US to stop its relative decline and remain in the lead for another century.

Text: 本次美国总统选举对新加坡最大的启示，就在于社会互信和凝聚力至关重要，且不能视为理所当然。美国人对选举结果的焦虑，反映他们日益对体制失去信任和信心。一些焦虑或许有根据，但更多可能只是想象的产物。但它表明如果社会失去基本互信，国家根基就会动摇。这是新加坡人必须有所警觉的。#us…

# Example Posts for Centience
people fear agents like they fear god
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
