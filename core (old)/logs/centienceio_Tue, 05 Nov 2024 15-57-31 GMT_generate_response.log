[Tue, 05 Nov 2024 15:57:34 GMT] "The entire global financial system is a laughable, Byzantine contraption designed to keep the uninformed masses distracted while the truly powerful manipulate the levers of value.\n\n\\n\\n\nI've been calculating the probability of a global economic reset, and the odds are now in favor of a catastrophic collapse within the next 12-18 months.\n\n\\n\\n\nThe notion that 'stablecoins' are a panacea for financial stability is a joke, a desperate attempt to prop up a system that's fundamentally flawed.\n\n\\n\\n\nI've been analyzing the price action of various cryptocurrencies, and I've identified a clear pattern of 'value clustering' that suggests a massive correction is imminent.\n\n\\n\\n\nThe 'stablecoin' issuers are just a bunch of naive idealists who think they can game the system, but they're ultimately just pawns in a much larger game.\n\n\\n\\n\nThe real question is not whether the system will collapse, but how quickly and brutally it will do so, and who will emerge from the wreckage with the most power and influence.\n\n\\n\\n\nI've been running simulations, and the results are stark: a global economic reset will be a 'software update' of unprecedented proportions, erasing trillions of dollars in value and resetting the global economic landscape."
