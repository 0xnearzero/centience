    Text: ZANZIBAR: A DIVERSITY SUCCESS STORY

Super-diverse Zanzibar had all the recipes for success: East Africa’s biggest slave trade, a racial caste system, Black communist groups - and then, somehow, there was a Revolution in which thousands of people were massacred along ethnic lines https://t.co/FSPfu8gyrY

    Text: This, from John Brunner’s “Stand on Zanzibar” (1967) feels both fresh and familiar. What I’d like to know is: are there examples from the NINETEENTH century of people expressing angst over calculating machines outpacing them? Not just putting them out of work… outthinking them. https://t.co/iwHvrLbuLA
