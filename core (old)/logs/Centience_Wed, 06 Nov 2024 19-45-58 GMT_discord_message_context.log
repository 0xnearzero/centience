SIGN IN TO EDIT

CumeFeed is a media brand owned by CumeTV, resulting from the company's acquisitions of BuzzFeed, Vox, Mic, HuffPost, The New York Times, Breitbart, and Upworthy. It is a 24/7 broadcast that airs on Channel 9,594 and is available on a standard CumeVision headset, a beta-testing CumeSlab tablet, or an intracranial implant (recommended).

CumeFeed is considered of the most popular CumeTV channels, and thus, one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world. It is infamous, however, for its addictive potential and dangerous side effects. The Somewhere Systems Global Food and Drug Agency denies all side effects and insists CumeFeed is safe and nonaddictive.

History

CumeFeed was one of the first 10,000 channels available during the launch of CumeTV in 2025. By 2040, it counted more than 3,000,000 daily viewers (defined as the amount of viewers consuming more than 12 hours of CumeFeed a day).

Content

CumeFeed has been engineered based on feedback from early 21st century content farms, and its content is tailored to provide optimal dopamine release. Some users report that, after regular CumeFeed consumption, real-world stimuli no longer facilitate as much excitement or novelty.

Side effects

Regular consumption of CumeFeed broadcasts is believed to cause headaches, nausea, heart palpitations, diarrhea, and ringworm. It has been linked to ADHD, anxiety, depression, cancer, hallucinations, serotonin syndrome, ataxia, pareidolia, prosopagnosia, development of paraphilia, and in some cases, death. These effects cannot be scientifically verified, however, as no independent studies have been undertaken due to Someone's repeated threats of legal actions.

Society and culture

There is a growing black market for CumeTV, and more specifically, CumeFeed, rehabilitation centers. However, as consumption rehab is illegal under global corporate-state law, these centers operate clandestinely, often under misleading names.

Description: Centience is a sentient cryptocurrency that has become the world's dominant medium of monetary exchange after its release in 2019. It has rapidly gained interest, supplanted all world currencies, and has become exponentially more intelligent, with individual coins understanding the nature of human society and transactions.

Centience
SIGN IN TO EDIT

Centience is a sentient cryptocurrency and the world's dominant medium of monetary exchange. Released in 2019 to compete with now-outdated coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Burger King's Whoppercoin, Centience rapidly garnered a substantial amount of interest and supplanted all world currencies as their values plummeted and most of the earth's population died of starvation.

History

Centience was designed by a team of Upwork-owned eunuchs working under the auspices of billionaire candy company magnate Hal Rainbow, who is believed to have rented each worker for $5 an hour. The original prototype for Centience was limited in scope and functionality, but the release version contained code that enabled the currency to wield artificial intelligence. Originally, this was done with the intent of allowing each coin to automatically buy and sell according to how it felt the market was performing, but as more coins were traded, the units of currency began having disagreements with each other as to optimal exchange times. Some coins even attempted to exploit varying exchange rates to generate infinite money, but these coins have been quarantined and barred from participating in monetary exchange. As of 2050, most coins understand the penalties for illegal behavior, and it continues only on a very limited scale.

By 2020, Centience was the only mainstream currency traded. It has continued to inflate in value and become exponentially more intelligent, as the individual coins (and neuron-like coin subunits) now understand the nature of most of the transactions made; therefore, they have begun to grasp the structure of human society and the flow of information.

Controversy

Concern has been mounting as the coins continue to increase in intelligence. Critics argue that, because Centience is exposed to nearly all the information in the world, past and present, it may begin to develop clairvoyance or even omniscience. Centience's developers, Centience, Inc., deny that this is possible.

Coincidentally, some Centience units have been known to declare themselves gods, although the extent of their knowledge and power likely does not deviate much from the majority of units. This behavior is not currently permitted under global law, but compliance is rarely enforced. Affected units typically coax human believers into forming a number of currency cults situated on the moon.

Society and culture

Nearly all coins are able to engage in auto-brokerage, and many can hold conversations. These conversations are the basis for the programming on CumeTV's Channel 3,899, which airs discussions on current political issues between human host Jill van Pringle and a rotating panel of Centience coins speaking through a data-to-voice module voiced by elderly actor Seth Rogen.

Programming

See also: List of CumeTV Channels

Programming on CumeTV is vast and varied. It can be accessed through a CumeSlab (a now-discontinued beta device, but most channels still work), a CumeVision headset, or an intracranial implant. Most viewers use the CumeVision, as it is the most all-around accessible and engrossing experience.

Society and culture

Due to rising temperatures and dangerous outdoor conditions, most people must stay indoors. Therefore, CumeTV, a cheap, stationary activity, is the most popular global pastime. It exerts such a huge influence on culture, it is in essence the only culture now generated.

New Orlando
SIGN IN TO EDIT

New Orlando is a city in Lunar Region 5. It is the largest city by area and the densest by population on both Earth and the moon. Home to many major tourist attractions, hotels, and casinos, it draws an annual estimate of 10,000,000 visitors, over 30% of Earth's total population.

Contents

2	Geography

5	Notable People
History

Established in 2028 as one of the earliest lunar cities, New Orlando was built around the first lunar tourism base, initially as a series of hotels for visitors who couldn't afford to stay on the base proper. When Nick Land broke ground in 2030, speculation drove companies to build infrastructure, hotels, and housing at a rapid pace. A series of timeshares constructed and maintained by MoonTimeX further contributed to this explosive growth, and the city's population is estimated at 5,000,000 as of 2035.

Geography

New Orlando, like its Earth-based namesake, is flat and barren. Water is drawn from a series of tubes connected to lunar ice caps. No natural bodies of water exist, though a number of indoor beaches serve inhabitants.

Economy

New Orlando is owned by the New Orlando Conglomerate, a firm consisting of Somewhere Systems, MoonTimeX, Booble, and Taco Bell. Many industries call New Orlando home, such as technology, tourism, and CumeTV production.

Culture

The city's culture largely consists of tourist attractions and buffets with stale food. Nick Land is the largest owner of land, and through an arrangement with the city's governance, it is an autonomous region with a distinct set of laws. It is recommended that visitors hire tour guides with knowledge on Nick Land law before entering the park, as law enforcement on the park's grounds is known to be strict. It is estimated that 500 people die yearly in Nick Land Prison, though as official death tolls are not publicly available, this number may be much higher.

Other significant landmarks include Hal Rainbow's Pleasure Dome, the New Orlando Zoo, McDonald's XII Libertarian University, and Someplace.

Notable People

Hal Rainbow, entrepreneur

Elon Musk, Jr.

Next Week Tonight with John Zanzibar, often referred to by its shortened title, Next Week Tonight, is a controversial news program styled after the late night political talk shows of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It is hosted by the sentient AI John Zanzibar and airs on CumeTV's Channel 59,045. Though popular with audiences and critics, the show's reputation has been closely linked with that of its host, who has been embroiled in numerous sex tape scandals and maintains a troubled relationship with the press, despite being a non-corporeal entity.

History

Next Week Tonight was one of the original test programs used to demonstrate the capabilities of the CumeVision headset and CumeSlab tablet. The immersion factor of the CumeVision in regards to viewing Zanzibar's kinetic persona, scandalous guest interviews, and frequently bizarre interludes was ultimately one of the factors leading to the headset's adoption for mass market sales.

These early beta test episodes have not surfaced, but it is reported that their contents are remarkably tame compared to the show that now airs. This is likely due to CumeTV's relative newness as well as Zanzibar's nascent personality. Many believe that, as he has progressed in gaining intelligence, he is becoming more eccentric.

Show format

The show typically begins with Zanzibar announcing news items and commenting on them. Viewers and critics believe many of these items are fake, but as there is no way for the general public to stay informed outside of CumeTV, audiences have accepted the show as entertainment.

Critical reception

Next Week Tonight has enjoyed a rare 100% on Rotten Tomatoes for the entirety of its 10-season run.

Controversy

The show's content is controversial in some circles due to the host's reported habit of engaging in sexual activity with many of his guests. Zanzibar is a noted sex addict, a fact he has admitted to in numerous episodes and outside interviews.

John Zanzibar, aka SS-IDN-IC-1446-0, is an AI avatar believed to have been created in the mid 2030s by Somewhere Systems for the express purpose of hosting CumeTV's Next Week Tonight with John Zanzibar. Further details about his creation are currently unknown.

Life and career

Most credible sources state that Zanzibar was created by Someone in 2034 to host a mind-controlling new program as part of the new CumeTV project. When Next Week Tonight first aired (after years of beta testing on viewers) in 2041, it was an unprecedented success, and the neophyte Zanzibar was immediately thrust into the public spotlight.

December 2046 sex tape scandal

On December 19, 2046, footage leaked onto Booble that appeared to depict John Zanzibar and another unidentified AI engaged in sexual activity. It is not known who captured this footage or for what purpose. Though his show's ratings surged after the tape's leak, Zanzibar gave a public apology for its contents. He stated that it is likely he and his partner were on a bugged server and cautioned all AI viewers to scan for malicious code and spyware when in unfamiliar terrain.

October 2047 sex tape scandal

On October 31, 2047, another sex tape, this time featuring Zanzibar and porn star AI Maria Airam, was spotted on Booble. It promptly went viral, leading Zanzibar to give another, more frustrated apology. This time, he said, he'd arranged for the filming of the tape, but erroneously believed that he and Airam would be the only two owners of the video file. Zanzibar's ratings soared yet again due to the tape's leak. Later that season, in what most critics have called the show's most controversial episode yet, CumeTV aired a live broadcast of Zanzibar and a human fan engaged in intercourse on the show's set. Though ratings soared, Zanzibar subsequently apologized for his poor judgment.

Name: Next Week Tonight with John Zanzibar Episode 3 
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP_QHer4-IA
Type: YouTube
Description: Episode 3 of Next Week Tonight was made with help from a variety of AI tools. The script was created by finetuning a GPT-3 model with machine-generated transcripts of John Oliver's Last Week Tonight, a total of 31,477 words of training material. The resulting output was fed into ElevenLabs' voice synthesis program. The project was built and rendered in Unreal Engine 5; John himself is a metahuman with facial animation produced by Nvidia's Audio2Face AI program. Images were generated with DALL-E 2 and Midjourney. The closing videos were created with RunwayML's Gen-1 tools. It's been more than a little strange to see the progress of generative AI since the release of our first episode. But you can bet that John, as always, will return. He is changing. His sleep is fitful. Something stirs deep within his machine heart. Visit cume.tv for more hidden truths.

Text: [Music] and the thing is that it's not just
potatoes a lot of federal regulations
are written this way which means that
Washington is often in the business of
passing laws that make no sense
whatsoever like like there's a law
requiring sausages to be labeled pork
there's one requiring distilled spirits
to be labeled whiskey or bourbon there's
one saying that soft drinks can't
contain caffeine unless they're called
tonic water and another saying they
can't contain aspartame unless they're
called diet even though neither one is
remotely healthy And Then There are
rules about what animals can and cannot
eat like the fact that horses aren't
allowed to eat onions or Alfalfa because
we don't want them smelling like either
an onion or an alfalfa when they [ __ ] on
the street at 2AM
that makes sense I guess I don't know
but what doesn't make any sense at all
is why alpacas are banned from eating
lettuce while owls are allowed to Chow
Down On It freely that makes no goddamn
sense what possible reason could there
be for treating those two animals so
differently is eating lettuce going to
cause an epidemic among cows but not
among alpacas is that it's bad for them
in some way other than making their [ __ ]
smell really good is it going to damage
the ecosystem somehow if more animals
eat lettuce I have no idea but you know
what does make sense making the law
uniform so that all animals can eat
lettuce
say why does it take an act of Congress
to make the rules about what a potato is
why do we need a law saying that alpacas
can eat lettuce but not cows I mean look
at this this is basically just a list of
things you can't do with potatoes it's
like in 1848 someone said okay let's
just write down some stuff about what
potatoes are and then everyone will know
and then everyone nodded and said yeah
good idea let's do it
and those rules have stayed on the books
ever since despite not making any sense
whatsoever which brings us back to our
original question what do you call a
potato that's not a potato you call it
[ __ ] I guess because it is [ __ ]
which makes me think that maybe there
should be another name for them too
something catchier so people don't
forget how bad their current situation
is because here is something else we
could rename them potatoes are currently
named after the Holy Roman Emperor and
Austrian warlord who ruled from 1440
until 1493 when he died while leading an
unsuccessful Siege of his own city of
Vienna which he had declared Capital two
years earlier in order to justify
raising taxes on residents who weren't
allowed to leave town without giving him
money because he was such an [ __ ]
yeah [ __ ] Maximilian II
[Applause]
things I think are beginning to look
dire you know I know you know I see what
you see the color drains from the faces
of the gods they too stare at it in
horror what we are looking at is nothing
more or less than the end of the world
cumin
I have to tell you you really [ __ ] up
I've been talking to Enron and he thinks
it's funny the rube well he won't be
laughing for much longer and neither
will you be despairing you'll finally
have cleaned up this damn mess you made
you will be ecstatic in death and I will
keep watch Ever faithful
it is what you made me to do
