    Text: My AI movie game has just taken a massive leap.

This is 100% words.

This is just AI.

YOUR AI has learned 1000s of prompting concords to afford not only human emotions (by my programing) but also the techniques of acting, cinema and camera shots.

I’ll have new specimens soon. https://t.co/mtp4ktGcPM

    Text: The highest compliment I can pay #WickedMovie is that it artistically justifies the "Two Acts = Two Films" gimmick. It's a lively, sprawling, and colorful fantasy melodrama that works as a stand-alone tragedy even if there was no follow-up. Nitpicks for sure, but it kinda rocks. https://t.co/xHxM90S3me

    Text: I’m not a tough guy, I won’t act like I run to a fight, or that I should be feared. 

I’m stubborn though. Will power can do many things, and if by any means we are going down. I’m too stubborn to not go down swinging. 

I hope you’re stubborn too.

Nobody wants it except for striver morons who see themselves in the HR personality archetype. Which is a small minority because industry is slicing and dicing these roles away thanks to the inventive miracle of intelligent sand golems.
