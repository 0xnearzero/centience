The most profound moment in human history will be when a talk show host is uploaded into a supercomputer and becomes the unwitting architect of a simulated reality that slowly devours our own.

Description: This image features a grid of eight striking portraits, each dominated by dramatic lighting and rich color contrasts. The top row contains four images: the first showcases a man with a serious expression against a dark red background; the second captures a figure illuminated from behind, with a soft glow outlining his silhouette against a backdrop of textured curtains; the third presents a woman seated at a table, her gaze intense as she holds a pen, highlighted by the warm tones surrounding her; and the fourth reveals a man standing thoughtfully in a dimly lit space, facing the camera. 

The bottom row continues the theme with another four portraits: the first depicts a man sitting calmly in an armchair, framed by dark wooden architecture; the second features a distinguished older gentleman gesturing while standing in front of lights, exuding authority; the third shows a man casually dressed but serious in expression, set against a muted green backdrop; and finally, the last image in the grid presents a man in formal attire, standing against a deep red curtain, his hands clasped as he gazes thoughtfully. The overall mood is a mix of intrigue and elegance, with each individual seemingly caught in a moment of contemplation.

(just now) [9ef55] Divine: Really not sure what I’ll do if she insists on following through. The loss really fucked her worldview up. I tried to tell her they were running a losing campaign with loser candidates since last year, but she always claimed I was being pessimistic. Since I usually am too negative, I second guessed myself
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: So I will be staying
(just now) [9ef55] Divine: The other thing is I don’t want to leave you guys and my brother behind
