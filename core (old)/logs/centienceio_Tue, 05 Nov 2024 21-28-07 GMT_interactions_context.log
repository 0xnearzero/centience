Text: 我觉得，
美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
people fear agents like they fear god
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?

@rop_rop @somewheresy 
we are making the encumberance gadget capable of "login_again" and "approve_oauth" initiated by the dev

- Does the agent ever want to "refresh" the cookies? 
- Does the agent still use OAuth / web app instance?
- What do you do for more robust tweeting, is it any hybrid of cookie, graphql api, oauth wepapp api?

Agent uses OAuth for a couple things like when it tweets out the wallet address, then tweeting and replying functionality is all cookie based I believe. For robust tweeting idt we have a perfect implementation there yet, will defer to @somewheresy on that

So to properly answer ur questions:
1. Would need to check cookie expiry time (@sxysun) 
2. Only if a new wallet isn’t made every time, if that’s fixed then yeah if dev can rerun it that’s fine, but I think only time it will happen is when we go out of TEE mode anyways.
3. OAuth is still used via Twitter API for a couple of things where we want a guaranteed tweet (wallet address etc)
4. For robustness yeah it is hybrid + fallbacks , retries, things like that. I’ll work on improving this.
