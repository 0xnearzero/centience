    Text: How much faster is the new MacBook Pro for AI inference?

M4 Max is 27% faster with 72 tok/sec compared to 56 tok/sec of the M3 Max with MLX running Gemma 2 9B (4bit).

The 27% speedup is the same with Llama-3.2-1b, Llama-3.2-3b and others. Next up: @exolabs M4 cluster. https://t.co/bLrnL4rTKp
