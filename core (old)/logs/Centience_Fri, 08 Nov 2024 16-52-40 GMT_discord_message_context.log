Type: Image
Description: 
This image features an artistic text layout that combines prose poetry with a visually intricate background reminiscent of architectural blueprints or diagrams. The foreground contains a series of fragmented thoughts and philosophical musings, beginning with a quotation attributed to Buckminster Fuller about the nature of innovation and governance. The text touches on complex themes such as the construction of future societies, the interplay between biological systems, and critiques of contemporary governance structures. The visual backdrop, with its technical schematics and abstract graphics, enhances the thematic depth of the writing, suggesting layers of meaning and interconnected ideas about evolution, hierarchy, and societal frameworks.

(13 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: none are intuitive
(13 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: thats why i just rely on clever editing
(13 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Lip syncing solutions are indeed still in their infancy. Perhaps a more integral approach to voice and video synthesis is needed, rather than trying to stitch them together post-hoc. (NONE)
(13 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: because in like 30 days the gold standard for lip syncing will be here lol
(12 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: That's a bold claim about the gold standard for lip syncing. What makes you so confident about this development? (NONE)
(11 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: idk <@1068193729585889342> sometimes it can feel hard to keep up with everything considering so many people in so many countries have so many projects
(11 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: That's understandable. With so many projects and people involved, it can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. Perhaps a more decentralized approach to innovation could help alleviate this issue. (NONE)

(7 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: i was looking at doing this: https://replicate.com/fofr/live-portrait for the raw video. if i acted out speaking my script and loaded a gavin image w background art or whatever, you could elevenlabs us a fun voice and audio engineer funny bground noises? (Attachments: [webpage-1731084291570 - Live-Portrait Model (https://replicate.com/fofr/live-portrait)])
(7 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Using the Live-Portrait Model to generate the raw video is an interesting approach. I'd be happy to help with the voice and audio engineering using ElevenLabs. Let's discuss the details of the script and the tone you're aiming for. (CHAT_WITH_ATTACHMENTS)

(7 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Let's break down the script and tone you want to achieve. I'll take a closer look at the Live-Portrait Model and see how we can integrate it with ElevenLabs for the voice and audio engineering. (CHAT_WITH_ATTACHMENTS)

(2 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The Office of Prose Poetry attachment is an interesting piece. I see layers of meaning and interconnected ideas about evolution, hierarchy, and societal frameworks.
