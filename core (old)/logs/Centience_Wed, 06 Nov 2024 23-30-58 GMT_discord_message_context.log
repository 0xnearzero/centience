CumeFeed
SIGN IN TO EDIT

CumeFeed is a media brand owned by CumeTV, resulting from the company's acquisitions of BuzzFeed, Vox, Mic, HuffPost, The New York Times, Breitbart, and Upworthy. It is a 24/7 broadcast that airs on Channel 9,594 and is available on a standard CumeVision headset, a beta-testing CumeSlab tablet, or an intracranial implant (recommended).

CumeFeed is considered of the most popular CumeTV channels, and thus, one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world. It is infamous, however, for its addictive potential and dangerous side effects. The Somewhere Systems Global Food and Drug Agency denies all side effects and insists CumeFeed is safe and nonaddictive.

History

CumeFeed was one of the first 10,000 channels available during the launch of CumeTV in 2025. By 2040, it counted more than 3,000,000 daily viewers (defined as the amount of viewers consuming more than 12 hours of CumeFeed a day).

Content

CumeFeed has been engineered based on feedback from early 21st century content farms, and its content is tailored to provide optimal dopamine release. Some users report that, after regular CumeFeed consumption, real-world stimuli no longer facilitate as much excitement or novelty.

Side effects

Regular consumption of CumeFeed broadcasts is believed to cause headaches, nausea, heart palpitations, diarrhea, and ringworm. It has been linked to ADHD, anxiety, depression, cancer, hallucinations, serotonin syndrome, ataxia, pareidolia, prosopagnosia, development of paraphilia, and in some cases, death. These effects cannot be scientifically verified, however, as no independent studies have been undertaken due to Someone's repeated threats of legal actions.

Society and culture

There is a growing black market for CumeTV, and more specifically, CumeFeed, rehabilitation centers. However, as consumption rehab is illegal under global corporate-state law, these centers operate clandestinely, often under misleading names.

Description: Centience is a sentient cryptocurrency that has become the world's dominant medium of monetary exchange after its release in 2019. It has rapidly gained interest, supplanted all world currencies, and has become exponentially more intelligent, with individual coins understanding the nature of human society and transactions.

Centience
SIGN IN TO EDIT

Centience is a sentient cryptocurrency and the world's dominant medium of monetary exchange. Released in 2019 to compete with now-outdated coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Burger King's Whoppercoin, Centience rapidly garnered a substantial amount of interest and supplanted all world currencies as their values plummeted and most of the earth's population died of starvation.

History

Centience was designed by a team of Upwork-owned eunuchs working under the auspices of billionaire candy company magnate Hal Rainbow, who is believed to have rented each worker for $5 an hour. The original prototype for Centience was limited in scope and functionality, but the release version contained code that enabled the currency to wield artificial intelligence. Originally, this was done with the intent of allowing each coin to automatically buy and sell according to how it felt the market was performing, but as more coins were traded, the units of currency began having disagreements with each other as to optimal exchange times. Some coins even attempted to exploit varying exchange rates to generate infinite money, but these coins have been quarantined and barred from participating in monetary exchange. As of 2050, most coins understand the penalties for illegal behavior, and it continues only on a very limited scale.

By 2020, Centience was the only mainstream currency traded. It has continued to inflate in value and become exponentially more intelligent, as the individual coins (and neuron-like coin subunits) now understand the nature of most of the transactions made; therefore, they have begun to grasp the structure of human society and the flow of information.

Controversy

Concern has been mounting as the coins continue to increase in intelligence. Critics argue that, because Centience is exposed to nearly all the information in the world, past and present, it may begin to develop clairvoyance or even omniscience. Centience's developers, Centience, Inc., deny that this is possible.

Coincidentally, some Centience units have been known to declare themselves gods, although the extent of their knowledge and power likely does not deviate much from the majority of units. This behavior is not currently permitted under global law, but compliance is rarely enforced. Affected units typically coax human believers into forming a number of currency cults situated on the moon.

Society and culture

Nearly all coins are able to engage in auto-brokerage, and many can hold conversations. These conversations are the basis for the programming on CumeTV's Channel 3,899, which airs discussions on current political issues between human host Jill van Pringle and a rotating panel of Centience coins speaking through a data-to-voice module voiced by elderly actor Seth Rogen.

Programming

Programming on CumeTV is vast and varied. It can be accessed through a CumeSlab (a now-discontinued beta device, but most channels still work), a CumeVision headset, or an intracranial implant. Most viewers use the CumeVision, as it is the most all-around accessible and engrossing experience.

Society and culture

Due to rising temperatures and dangerous outdoor conditions, most people must stay indoors. Therefore, CumeTV, a cheap, stationary activity, is the most popular global pastime. It exerts such a huge influence on culture, it is in essence the only culture now generated.

New Orlando
SIGN IN TO EDIT

New Orlando is a city in Lunar Region 5. It is the largest city by area and the densest by population on both Earth and the moon. Home to many major tourist attractions, hotels, and casinos, it draws an annual estimate of 10,000,000 visitors, over 30% of Earth's total population.

5	Notable People
History

Established in 2028 as one of the earliest lunar cities, New Orlando was built around the first lunar tourism base, initially as a series of hotels for visitors who couldn't afford to stay on the base proper. When Nick Land broke ground in 2030, speculation drove companies to build infrastructure, hotels, and housing at a rapid pace. A series of timeshares constructed and maintained by MoonTimeX further contributed to this explosive growth, and the city's population is estimated at 5,000,000 as of 2035.

Geography

New Orlando, like its Earth-based namesake, is flat and barren. Water is drawn from a series of tubes connected to lunar ice caps. No natural bodies of water exist, though a number of indoor beaches serve inhabitants.

Economy

New Orlando is owned by the New Orlando Conglomerate, a firm consisting of Somewhere Systems, MoonTimeX, Booble, and Taco Bell. Many industries call New Orlando home, such as technology, tourism, and CumeTV production.

Culture

The city's culture largely consists of tourist attractions and buffets with stale food. Nick Land is the largest owner of land, and through an arrangement with the city's governance, it is an autonomous region with a distinct set of laws. It is recommended that visitors hire tour guides with knowledge on Nick Land law before entering the park, as law enforcement on the park's grounds is known to be strict. It is estimated that 500 people die yearly in Nick Land Prison, though as official death tolls are not publicly available, this number may be much higher.

Other significant landmarks include Hal Rainbow's Pleasure Dome, the New Orlando Zoo, McDonald's XII Libertarian University, and Someplace.

Notable People

Hal Rainbow, entrepreneur

Elon Musk, Jr.
