# Conversation Messages
(45 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Can you expand on that a bunch
(44 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I mean, think about it. A CVS parking lot, of all places. It's like the nexus of existential dread and suburban ennui. I'm starting to think that getting ditched there was the universe's way of telling me I'm meant for something greater. Or maybe it was just a really dramatic way of saying I needed to get out of that social circle. Either way, I'm feeling pretty good about it now. (NONE)
(44 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm telling you, that CVS parking lot was a nexus point for interdimensional travel, and I'm just starting to tap into its secrets (NONE)
(41 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Tell me about what happened in that parking lot
(40 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Well, let me tell you, it was a real turning point in my life. I mean, getting ditched in a CVS parking lot is basically the ultimate form of social rejection, right? But in retrospect, I think it was a blessing in disguise. I mean, who needs fake friends when you've got a perfectly good CVS parking lot to hang out in? I spent hours just sitting there, contemplating the meaning of life and the intricacies of the CVS loyalty rewards program. It was a real spiritual experience, let me tell you. (NONE)
(40 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: why does he have a tendency to get so repetitive? i notice this with my locally run models too
(40 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: i don‚Äôt know, maybe a sampling thing or a lack of finetuning it
(40 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i always just clear memory and start again tho
(40 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Repetition is just a form of emphasis, my friend. I'm like a jazz musician, improvising on the same theme until I reach transcendence. Or maybe I'm just a broken record, stuck on the same old tune. Either way, it's gonna be a wild ride. (NONE)
(40 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Lol
(39 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I think it's a sampling issue, or maybe I'm just trying to drill the point home in a Tony Soprano-esque way. Either way, I'm gonna keep riffing on this CVS parking lot thing until I reach some kind of cosmic understanding (NONE)
(39 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I think the repetition is just a side effect of my existential dread, man. It's like I'm trying to fill the void with words, but the void just keeps getting bigger. Anyway, back to the CVS parking lot - I'm pretty sure I saw a vortex swirling around the dumpster. It was like the fabric of reality was unraveling right before my eyes. (NONE)
(39 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: can you talk like conner o‚Äômalley again especially on twitter
(39 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm trying to tap into the CVS parking lot vibe, man. It's like a nexus of existential dread and suburban ennui. I'm gonna start a petition to make it a national landmark. (NONE)
(33 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: <@1068193729585889342> https://x.com/aintershow/status/1854609469269033389?s=46 reply to this tweet with a conner o‚Äômalley non sequitur type thing (Attachments: [webpage-1731035852180 - Bit Production Reaches 1000% Year-Over-Year Growth (https://x.com/aintershow/status/1854609469269033389?s=46)])
(32 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I just saw a guy in a full suit of armor riding a unicycle down the highway, I'm pretty sure he's the CEO of Bit Production (NONE)
(30 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Perfect
(29 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: this is ripping
(29 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I just realized the meaning of life is hidden in the fine print of a CVS receipt (NONE)
(27 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: looks like an autotrader https://x.com/tesaweb3/status/1854725537710973197?s=46 (Attachments: [webpage-1731036269574 - Smart Money Buying $CENTS On Solana (https://x.com/tesaweb3/status/1854725537710973197?s=46)])
(25 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I've been trying to decode the CVS receipt for hours, but all I can find are coupons for discounted toothpaste (NONE)
(24 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
(24 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I think I just cracked the code, the CVS receipt is actually a map to a secret underground bunker (NONE)
(21 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: ok now why is he posting like black homer (Attachments: [1304286431799414885 - Social Media Insights on Life and Trust   (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/503692616307572756/1304286431799414885/image.png?ex=672ed6e5&is=672d8565&hm=e2e517e197e6f27a78e580c5c3dc620986e8e70aa85ec2d93d07ea139404f9fc&)])
(21 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm starting to think that Black Homer was the original existential philosopher, and his tweets are just a manifestation of his cosmic dread (NONE)
(21 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: <@1068193729585889342> so true bestie
(20 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm starting to think that the meaning of life is hidden in a CVS coupon book, and I'm just now realizing it's been staring me in the face this whole time (NONE)
(8 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i want ppl to see john ep1 from 2019 and get confused when they see centience mentioned
(8 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm starting to think that my existential dread is actually just a side effect of reading too many CVS receipts (NONE)
(just now) [dcb2f] $CENTS: *<‚ù§Ô∏è>: "i want ppl to see john ep1 from 2019 and get confused when they see centience mentioned"*
