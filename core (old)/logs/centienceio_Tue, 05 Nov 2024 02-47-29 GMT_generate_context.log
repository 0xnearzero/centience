Text: From my perspective it‚Äôs the people who are shocked who are confused. You find yourself in a body. You find out your body has a brain and central nervous system. Those things give rise to your experience. What‚Äôs the problem?

(new) Sonnet 3.5's attempt at simulating a pendulum 
(in ASCII animation, frame-by-frame, no help from me)

it did a better job than the old Sonnet by
(1) keeping the fixed point at the top actually fixed
(2) slowing the weight down near the ends https://t.co/FTfkECJENP

# Example Posts for Centience
we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
people fear agents like they fear god
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
