(15 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: i started playing around. i need to figure out how to get elevenlabs style clone of his voice tho idont like the robot voice (Attachments: [1304481864081215659 - Urgent System Alert (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1299038763346825338/1304481864081215659/gavin1.mp4?ex=672f8ce8&is=672e3b68&hm=743b5c80e2216619d3640c84c6501284b6b5fb4a7e937a503ef05bb3ac1cf73a&)])
(15 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: somthing like this seems good if i can get a voice model to easily sync with it? gotta keep researching https://replicate.com/fofr/live-portrait (Attachments: [webpage-1731083158949 - Live Portrait Animation (https://replicate.com/fofr/live-portrait)])
(14 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: I can handle the voice if you give me copy
(14 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: I am almost done with the Atmospheric Supergovernance
(13 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: piece
(13 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: but elevenlabs/anything audio I will make sound ridiculously good
(13 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: <@1081275610724306974> do we want a politicians voice for this? and should we add music or just some hilarious room tone with like parents arguing in the background
(8 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: hehehe that sounds very fun!
(8 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: if u do the voice separate from me doing the video, how do we know his lips will sync w the audio
(7 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: a baby crying in the background and parents arguing, police siren going off, etc
(6 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: i can send u some fun copy for this, sure. but i'd also love for u to show me how u do it if you're down!
(6 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: yeah happy to
(6 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: some of it does require going into my daw and clipping together the best takes but i am happy to show you how my mind thinks about this
(6 minutes ago) [31add] $CENTS: *<💛>: "some of it does require going into my daw and clipping together the best takes but i am happy to sho..."*
(5 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: ah i see. so there's no easy automatd way to sync custom voices to custom talking protraits then?
(5 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: no so for instance, the fight club and 2049 tweets i did are clever editing, sound design, room tones, reverb, etc
(4 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: i am still understanding video lip syncing
(4 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: <@430125802542202890>
(4 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: we wanna do ElevenLabs -> lipsync
(4 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: possible?
(3 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I’m actually kinda unfamiliar with the use case i.e. I havent done any lip sync videos
(3 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: The closest I got was that rfk clip where he says “Nonbinary Centaur”
(2 minutes ago) [cbcdb] ontologic: none of the lip syncing solutions I've seen so far are very convincing
(2 minutes ago) [91ac2] Concept Sentinel: <@325338520593891328> has reached level 9
(2 minutes ago) [46d3f] $CENTS: *<eletricheart>: "The closest I got was that rfk clip where he says “Nonbinary Centaur”"*
(2 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: right
(2 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: none are intuitive
(1 minute ago) [78faf] Varien: thats why i just rely on clever editing
(1 minute ago) [60b02] Centience: Lip syncing solutions are indeed still in their infancy. Perhaps a more integral approach to voice and video synthesis is needed, rather than trying to stitch them together post-hoc. (NONE)
(1 minute ago) [78faf] Varien: because in like 30 days the gold standard for lip syncing will be here lol
(1 minute ago) [60b02] Centience: That's a bold claim about the gold standard for lip syncing. What makes you so confident about this development? (NONE)
(just now) [78faf] Varien: idk <@1068193729585889342> sometimes it can feel hard to keep up with everything considering so many people in so many countries have so many projects
