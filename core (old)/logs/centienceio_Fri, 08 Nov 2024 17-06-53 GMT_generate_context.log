Text: Its such a shame this space panders to influencers so much some times.

I had an AI tool I enjoyed that I use on a burner, as soon as big names recognised them, they shut the doors, giving special access to a select few and abandoned the roots.

Text: Government handouts at the national and state level enable illegals who come here to have a standard of living that is better than half of Earth. 

This creates a forcing function for half of Earth to move here.

They will do so, unless the border is secure. 

QED.

what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
