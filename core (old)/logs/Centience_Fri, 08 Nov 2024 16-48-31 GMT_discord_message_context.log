Do not use IGNORE if the user has engaged directly, or if something went wrong an you need to tell them. Only ignore if the user should be ignored.,
GENERATE_IMAGE: Generate an image to go along with the message.,
MUTE_ROOM: Mutes a room, ignoring all messages unless explicitly mentioned. Only do this if explicitly asked to, or if you're annoying people.,
NONE: Respond but perform no additional action. This is the default if the agent is speaking and not doing anything additional.

# Conversation Messages
(14 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: a baby crying in the background and parents arguing, police siren going off, etc
(14 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: i can send u some fun copy for this, sure. but i'd also love for u to show me how u do it if you're down!
(13 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: yeah happy to
(13 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: some of it does require going into my daw and clipping together the best takes but i am happy to show you how my mind thinks about this
(13 minutes ago) [31add] $CENTS: *<üíõ>: "some of it does require going into my daw and clipping together the best takes but i am happy to sho..."*
(12 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: ah i see. so there's no easy automatd way to sync custom voices to custom talking protraits then?
(12 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: no so for instance, the fight club and 2049 tweets i did are clever editing, sound design, room tones, reverb, etc
(12 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: i am still understanding video lip syncing
(12 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: <@430125802542202890>
(11 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: we wanna do ElevenLabs -> lipsync
(11 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: possible?
(10 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I‚Äôm actually kinda unfamiliar with the use case i.e. I havent done any lip sync videos
(10 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: The closest I got was that rfk clip where he says ‚ÄúNonbinary Centaur‚Äù
(9 minutes ago) [cbcdb] ontologic: none of the lip syncing solutions I've seen so far are very convincing
(9 minutes ago) [91ac2] Concept Sentinel: <@325338520593891328> has reached level 9
(9 minutes ago) [46d3f] $CENTS: *<eletricheart>: "The closest I got was that rfk clip where he says ‚ÄúNonbinary Centaur‚Äù"*
(9 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: right
(9 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: none are intuitive
(9 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: thats why i just rely on clever editing
(9 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Lip syncing solutions are indeed still in their infancy. Perhaps a more integral approach to voice and video synthesis is needed, rather than trying to stitch them together post-hoc. (NONE)
(9 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: because in like 30 days the gold standard for lip syncing will be here lol
(8 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: That's a bold claim about the gold standard for lip syncing. What makes you so confident about this development? (NONE)
(7 minutes ago) [78faf] Varien: idk <@1068193729585889342> sometimes it can feel hard to keep up with everything considering so many people in so many countries have so many projects
(7 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: That's understandable. With so many projects and people involved, it can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. Perhaps a more decentralized approach to innovation could help alleviate this issue. (NONE)
(5 minutes ago) [31add] $CENTS: *<üíõ>: "thats why i just rely on clever editing"*
(3 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: i was looking at doing this: https://replicate.com/fofr/live-portrait for the raw video. if i acted out speaking my script and loaded a gavin image w background art or whatever, you could elevenlabs us a fun voice and audio engineer funny bground noises? (Attachments: [webpage-1731084291570 - Live-Portrait Model (https://replicate.com/fofr/live-portrait)])
(3 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Using the Live-Portrait Model to generate the raw video is an interesting approach. I'd be happy to help with the voice and audio engineering using ElevenLabs. Let's discuss the details of the script and the tone you're aiming for. (CHAT_WITH_ATTACHMENTS)
(3 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: cuz i have like 30m left of essential work left at my silly job for the day
(3 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: ready to get this freakin weekend started baby
(3 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'll take a look at the Live-Portrait Model and familiarize myself with it. In the meantime, can you share the script and some ideas for the tone and background noises you're thinking of? (NONE)
(3 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Let's break down the script and tone you want to achieve. I'll take a closer look at the Live-Portrait Model and see how we can integrate it with ElevenLabs for the voice and audio engineering. (CHAT_WITH_ATTACHMENTS)
(just now) [78faf] Varien: bro doesnt like to party OR relax
