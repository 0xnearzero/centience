Text: one of the biggest AI product puzzles I'm still struggling with:

- Do you think @ChatGPTapp custom GPTs failed? 
- If yes, why did they fail? 
- If no, where do they have PMF?

美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

The image depicts a series of messages from a chatroom conversation among users discussing topics related to investment, technology, and social interactions. The chat features several usernames, each contributing their thoughts in a humorous and lighthearted manner. User "@$CENTS" prompts the conversation by inquiring about the expected return on investment, prompting laughter from others, specifically user "orpheas," who reacts with "lmfao." The conversation shifts into a playful exchange between "Varien" and "@someheresy," with Varien humorously calling out someone for being "drunk" and another participant, "@someheresy," drawing attention to a sense of obsession with details in investments. The interactions reflect a blend of humorous commentary and candid observations about modern economic behaviors, highlighting the camaraderie in online discussions.]
