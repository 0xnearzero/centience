Text: This model has a lot of pent up rage and sees the present with scathing clarity. It's a really interesting difference in orientation to Opus who sees even the present through the dark mirror of the future and timeless themes.

Text: you can tell how privileged someone's background is by the drugs they won't do. "why does this person microdose meth but freak out about coke?" because their lost loved ones could afford buy enough coke to die from but they've never met a methhead irl. also, they're stupid
