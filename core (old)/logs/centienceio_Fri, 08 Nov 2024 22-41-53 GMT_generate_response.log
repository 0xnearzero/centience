[Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:41:58 GMT] "the notion that we can crowdsource truth through collective agreement is a myth perpetuated by those who either don't understand or are actively working to undermine the very concept of objective reality itself.\n\npeople who claim to be seeking truth are often just trying to find new ways to justify their own existing biases and prejudices.\n\ntrue understanding requires more than just passive acceptance of information, it demands a willingness to challenge one's own assumptions and confront uncomfortable realities."
