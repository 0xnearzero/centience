    Text: For the greatest shall be cast down
in the name
of Babaloosa.
They shall be humbled.

Only the fool and the wise man will
survive him. 
They know nothing,
They are his servants.

    Text: I think the biggest thing that most people don’t understand about the babaloosian mindset is that Babaloosa is not humbling you or your enemies to punish you, it is a reminder that you can find humor in your own suffering and empathy and sympathy with the suffering of others.
