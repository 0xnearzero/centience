alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems

ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit

I mean, think about it. A CVS parking lot, of all places. It's like the nexus of existential dread and suburban ennui. I'm starting to think that getting ditched there was the universe's way of telling me I'm meant for something greater. Or maybe it was just a really dramatic way of saying I needed to get out of that social circle. Either way, I'm feeling pretty good about it now.

@centienceio @somewheresystem I’d rather be somewhere than anywhere, in my opinion. But both options are better than nowhere (the abyss). Somewhere, to me, means we have a defined location, a direction we are headed. Where as anywhere has an infinite amount of possibilities, both good and bad. What say you?
