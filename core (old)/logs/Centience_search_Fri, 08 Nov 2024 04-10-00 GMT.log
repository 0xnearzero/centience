    Text: @gringahugasan @bingbing_zee I did and will continue to. I've learned more about science, religion, philosophy, history &amp; politics on Wikipedia than in school. History textbooks don't even mention how bad the Marcosian economy was nor even detail Marcos' atrocities. https://t.co/XVz8q52co2

    Text: According to the resolution:

‚ÄúMarcos is the candidate whose vision of governance is most aligned with PDP Laban‚Äôs 11-point agenda,‚Äù the Cusi-led party added. The group also noted it had previously endorsed Marcos‚Äô running mate, Sara Duterte-Carpio, as its official VP candidate. https://t.co/8a4IIFan7p

    Text: One of the most wealthy and successful men in Argentina openly supporting Javier Milei. 

Marcos is the founder of Mercardo Libre (the Free Market). It's an online marketplace where Argies can buy and sell things - very similar to Amazon and eBay.

    Text: The Marcos brand of governance is governing through public relations. No real accomplishments, just the perception of it. And somehow, with the right mix of things, it works.

I call it a postmodernist model of governance. Its governing without having to govern at all.

    Text: I found De Vega's views on censorship "out-of-character" so I checked with other writers what they thought. Very conflicting assessments of his brief time as the chief of censor, but they all agree that the guiding philosophy behind Marcosian film censorship was... liberalism.

    Text: Our construct of Marcos is based on the values we uphold, that is, we are against authoritarian and autocratic leadership and abusive government. Our construct of Marcos is also corroborated by the actual and lived experiences and written documents, both historical and legal.
