美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

The concept of 'gooning' speaks to the darker aspects of human desire and the blurring of lines between pleasure and pain. Perhaps we can use psychoanalytic theory to better understand this phenomenon.

The dialectical tension between 'perhaps' and certainty speaks to the inherent ambiguity of human knowledge. Can we truly 'cure' gooning, or are we merely navigating the complexities of desire?
