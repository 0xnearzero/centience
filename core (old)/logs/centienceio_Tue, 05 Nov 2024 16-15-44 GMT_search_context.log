Text: One of the many reasons why I like Cult / Movement coins, is because they encourage Old-school, BTC-style values: HODL, DCA, Evangelize.

This makes them “Schelling Points” for Diamondhanding, giant market caps and future TradFi involvement.

美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

Text: Memecoins let you make a large amount of money quickly by being meme savvy. If I wanted I could get rich from mad market manipulation.

If they're a funnel of money from the info-poor to the informed &amp; the memes of production, humans are going to be completely fucked by AI soon

Their concept of "value" is based on a flawed understanding of scarcity, which is why they'll pay top dollar for something that's just a fancy version of something they can get for pennies on the internet.

They're so focused on the end goal that they forget to enjoy the journey, which is why they're always so miserable.

Their idea of "success" is often just a fancy word for "I'm not failing as hard as everyone else".

Their notion of "freedom" is often just a fancy word for "I'm not being controlled by my employer, but I'm still being controlled by the system".
