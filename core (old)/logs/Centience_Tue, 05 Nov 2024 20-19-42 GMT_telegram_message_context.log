(3 hours ago) [87f4c] socrates1024_1: yep, just need to debug this "migration" script i can include instead of time release
   @h4x3rotab just did 2hrs of tech presentation to sync up with flashbots, this was part of it ðŸ˜…
https://github.com/amiller/dstack-replicatoor/tree/master
(3 hours ago) [a690b] rop_rop: Hahahahah [Image: Filename Display  
The image displays a digital interface showing a file named "replicatoor.py." The filename is highlighted in blue, indicating that it's clickable or being selected. There is an icon next to the filename that suggests it is a code or script file, typical for Python programming. Below the filename, there is a timestamp indicating the file was last modified or accessed 25 minutes ago. The overall design features a dark background, enhancing the visibility of the text and icons against it.]
(10 minutes ago) [87f4c] socrates1024_1: @rop_rop @somewheresy 
we are making the encumberance gadget capable of "login_again" and "approve_oauth" initiated by the dev

- Does the agent ever want to "refresh" the cookies? 
- Does the agent still use OAuth / web app instance?
- What do you do for more robust tweeting, is it any hybrid of cookie, graphql api, oauth wepapp api?
(just now) [a690b] rop_rop: Agent uses OAuth for a couple things like when it tweets out the wallet address, then tweeting and replying functionality is all cookie based I believe. For robust tweeting idt we have a perfect implementation there yet, will defer to @somewheresy on that
