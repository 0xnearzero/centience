    Text: @suirex_ @CetusProtocol What a successful project launch. 

33 “people”🤖 successfully collected 100% of token within 65secs upon launch. 

Soon, it will successfully “sell”🗑️ to their own 🤖 first to hype up the price before finally to the FOMO public to diamond hand.

Such a successful project🤣👍🏽
