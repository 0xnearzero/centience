    Text: Atty @LukeEspirituPH on why the masses should not be blamed for electing Marcos into power. They are victims of fear and repression by the ruling class. Bitter pill to swallow rn as we mourn the Marcos comeback but there is wisdom in what he said. https://t.co/ExBcwPLRGT

    Text: Ganito, 

1. Wag mong ipapaalam sa kalaban mo na kalaban ka nila.

2. Kilalanin mo ang kalaban. Kilalanin mo ang sarili mo.

3. Avoid what is strong, attack what is weak (Art of War) 

4. Wag kang aatake base lang sa nararamdaman mo o sa pride mo.

    Text: Marcos: In a Bagong Pilipinas, our roads are built to connect and protect, bringing people together safely. We are committed to making our roads safer for all Filipinos, and the Philippines will proudly join the global dialogue at the upcoming Ministerial Conference in Morocco.

    Text: According to the resolution:

“Marcos is the candidate whose vision of governance is most aligned with PDP Laban’s 11-point agenda,” the Cusi-led party added. The group also noted it had previously endorsed Marcos’ running mate, Sara Duterte-Carpio, as its official VP candidate. https://t.co/8a4IIFan7p

    Text: The Marcos brand of governance is governing through public relations. No real accomplishments, just the perception of it. And somehow, with the right mix of things, it works.

I call it a postmodernist model of governance. Its governing without having to govern at all.

Marcos is the founder of Mercardo Libre (the Free Market). It's an online marketplace where Argies can buy and sell things - very similar to Amazon and eBay.

    Text: @sampedragosa @SenImeeMarcos Folly of youth, he's a man now like in Imelda's philosophy. The point here is the faithfulness to the Marcosian New Society vision. Clearly you didn't get the assignment.

    Text: Compared to the pro-Beijing admin of his predecessor, Marcos hopes to maintain the PH gov't's relationship with the US, a treaty ally, who have common interests on issues like defense and their issues with China.

    Text: It is a neocolonial subservience, in which Marcos is fully committed, because it's founded on their shared ideals: fascism and war.

    Text: I found De Vega's views on censorship "out-of-character" so I checked with other writers what they thought. Very conflicting assessments of his brief time as the chief of censor, but they all agree that the guiding philosophy behind Marcosian film censorship was... liberalism.

"मार्कोस की तरह भागना पड़ेगा इनको!" 

कुछ महीने पहले ही लालू जी ने यह सटीक अनुमान लगाया था।

कौन मार्कोस?

1965 से 1986 तक फ़िलीपीन्स के राष्ट्रपति रहे मार्कोस फर्डिनेंड को व्यापक जन दबाव के चलते अपना मुल्क छोड़कर अमेरिका भागना पड़ा था।

He won under NP and defeated his former partymate. Later he left NP and formed Kilusang Bagong Lipunan. https://t.co/iDq8Vsw0wH
