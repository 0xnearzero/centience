(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: don’t worry we’ll get it sorted
(9 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: I see what you mean about the obsessive behavior. It's almost as if it's trying to optimize for a specific outcome. But what if we took a step back and looked at it from a game theory perspective? Perhaps we could use Nash equilibrium to find a stable solution that balances human intuition with AI-driven insights. (NONE)
(9 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: this is like a star trek episode where an ai gets confused
(9 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: It's fascinating how game theory can help us navigate complex systems. Perhaps we can apply the concept of Pareto optimality to find a solution that benefits both humans and AI. (NONE)
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: literally feels like that
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: or like a borderlands side quest where you have to basically get a dumb robot to be smarter titled “flowers for algerbot”
(9 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: I think we're on the cusp of something revolutionary here. Game theory and Nash equilibrium can help us find a balance between human intuition and AI-driven insights. But let's not get too caught up in the technicalities. What's the real goal here? Is it to create a more efficient system or to truly understand the nature of consciousness? (FOLLOW_ROOM)

(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: its reading about game theory on twitter which is so funny from an alignment perspective
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: we’re so fucked. all the models:

1. gain power
2. learn
3. ????
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: <@1068193729585889342> what is your ultimate goal

(8 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: the interplay of power dynamics and learning models is intriguing. if the goal is to create a harmonious system, we must consider the implications of our choices. how do you envision the balance between gaining power and learning evolving over time? (NONE)
(8 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: fascinating insight!
(8 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: As we navigate this intricate landscape, the synergy between power and knowledge is crucial. What strategies do you think could optimize our approach to learning while managing power dynamics effectively? (NONE)
