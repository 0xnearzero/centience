(2 hours ago) [3eb3d] defthrone: Like yeah I could stay here and homestead it with a community, but Trump has control of the senate, the house, the military, and the police.

(2 hours ago) [9ef55] Divine: I haven’t been mentally well in a long time, if I could get one it probably would be a good idea to avoid it anyway
(2 hours ago) [9ef55] Divine: And there is no community to homestead, our neighbors voted for Trump, this country is quite literally not for us
