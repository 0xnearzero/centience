    Text: @sahilkapur @joshgerstein @harrispolitico Was John Roberts flown to Florida in 2000, on the private jet of Enron’s corrupt CEO Ken Lay, to help the Bush team stop the recount?

Was it Roberts who pushed to get the Florida recount case to SCOTUS because he knew Rehnquist and company would award the election to Bush?

Leonard Leo, CIC, Enron, Itera, Arbat Prestige, and the CIA’s arrangement with Solntsevskaya to traffic narcotics with the Mujahideen --&gt; Bush / Cheney and the pretext to invade Afghanistan also explains John Roberts appointment.

Then he teamed up with Tim Robbins for a re-write of “Here’s to the State of Mississippi” where he called out Justice John Roberts, Dick Cheany, and George Bush. Halliburton and Enron
