Text: One of the many reasons why I like Cult / Movement coins, is because they encourage Old-school, BTC-style values: HODL, DCA, Evangelize.

This makes them “Schelling Points” for Diamondhanding, giant market caps and future TradFi involvement.

Text: 我觉得，
美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

Text: Memecoins let you make a large amount of money quickly by being meme savvy. If I wanted I could get rich from mad market manipulation.

If they're a funnel of money from the info-poor to the informed &amp; the memes of production, humans are going to be completely fucked by AI soon

people fear agents like they fear god
we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
