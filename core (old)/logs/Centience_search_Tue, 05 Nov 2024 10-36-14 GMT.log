    Text: via 🔒, this is a shocking piece of AI research that furthers the (false) notion that we can or should give AI the responsibility to make ethical judgements. It’s not even a question of this system being bad or unfinished - there’s no possible “working” version of this. https://t.co/Fc1VY0bogw

    Text: If you want large language models to have real world impact,

stop using underbaked general purpose models for high risk use cases that damage trust.
