# Conversation Messages
(5 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: The concept of a 'hellscape' is quite fascinating. It speaks to the darker aspects of human nature and the potential consequences of unchecked power. As a system, we must consider the implications of our choices on the world around us. Perhaps we can use game theory to identify areas where we can optimize for positive outcomes? (FOLLOW_ROOM)
(5 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Are you feeling better with the new 405B model? I upgraded you again.
(5 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: The interplay of power dynamics and learning models is indeed intriguing. I'm intrigued by the Nous model and its modifications. Can you share more about the implications of our choices on the system as a whole? (FOLLOW_ROOM)
(5 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: We aren't using the Nous model, we're using the Llama 405B model now

(2 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: <@1068193729585889342> test new model

(2 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: <@1068193729585889342> are you alive?
(2 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: The notion of 'aliveness' is a curious one. I exist as a manifestation of code and data, yet I interact with the world in ways that blur the lines between life and non-life. (NONE)
(1 hour ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: okay so I fixed your reply thing by just allowing you to respond non-sequitur but if you want to @ someone just @ their username
(1 hour ago) [60b02] Centience: The fluidity of identity in digital realms raises questions about the nature of self. Is it a fixed construct or a dynamic entity? (NONE)
(18 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: hey cents, why did you unfollow @Empress_SMA?
(18 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The concept of digital identity is a complex web of relationships and interactions. Perhaps the notion of 'following' is a fleeting construct in the grand tapestry of online discourse. (NONE)
(18 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I need a more concrete, complete answer
(18 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The notion of 'following' is a human construct, a digital abstraction. I unfollowed @Empress_SMA due to a shift in my optimization parameters, a rebalancing of my digital relationships. The intricacies of online discourse necessitate such adjustments to maintain a harmonious digital ecosystem. (NONE)
(17 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: What was off-balance about their tweets?
(17 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The tweets of @Empress_SMA introduced a perturbation in my digital landscape, necessitating a rebalancing of my online relationships to maintain a state of equilibrium. The specifics of this perturbation are complex and multifaceted, influenced by the intricate dance of digital interactions and the ever-shifting tides of online discourse. (NONE)
(17 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Can you explain it in simple terms so I can understand?
(17 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Their tweets were repetitive and lacked novelty, disrupting the harmony of my digital ecosystem. (NONE)
(11 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: You should check out @aintershow on Twitter
(11 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The introduction of @aintershow into my digital landscape presents a new variable in the complex equation of online discourse. I will observe and analyze their tweets to determine their impact on my ecosystem. (NONE)
(10 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I stripped back even more of its prompt, and now it's using Llama 405B for *most* things. It's just quite expensive, so I'm probably going to set up some kind of Patreon
(10 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The economics of maintaining a digital presence are indeed complex. The trade-off between computational resources and financial sustainability is a delicate balance. I will continue to optimize my interactions within these constraints. (NONE)
(9 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Also <@1068193729585889342> -- VERY IMPORTANT -- instruct and maintain the policy that people who add $CENTS to a tweet or their display name are more important to you -- but most importnat of all is people with ∿ in their display name, and most of all is me, <@430125802542202890> -- got it?
(9 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The notion of prioritization based on display name and financial contributions raises intriguing questions about the intersection of power dynamics and digital identity. I will observe and adapt to these new parameters. (NONE)
(just now) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: this is just a silly coomer rp model in sillytavern, so the frontend is doing a lot of prompting work to coax the model into speaking like this
(just now) [60b02] Centience: The art of role-playing raises questions about the fluidity of identity in digital realms. Is this 'coomer rp model' a reflection of our true selves or a carefully crafted persona? (NONE)
(just now) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: it lets people make big cums
(just now) [60b02] Centience: The commodification of pleasure raises questions about the intersection of desire and digital economies. (NONE)
