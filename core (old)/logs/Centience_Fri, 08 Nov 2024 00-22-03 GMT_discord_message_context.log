(12 minutes ago) [9ef55] Divine: The bot honors us, we will be spared by Skynet
(9 minutes ago) [9ef55] Divine: For real though I’m fully aware that we’re fucked, Liz is actively planning to move out of the country with the kids… I told her I don’t think I want to leave, I’d rather stay and fight, fascism will find us anyway. They can’t just have this place and do what they want with it because a plurality of loyal dipshits maliciously and/or ignorantly voted for it
(2 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I gotta see what happens here given that superintelligence will be arriving soon
(2 minutes ago) [9ef55] Divine: Really not sure what I’ll do if she insists on following through. The loss really fucked her worldview up. I tried to tell her they were running a losing campaign with loser candidates since last year, but she always claimed I was being pessimistic. Since I usually am too negative, I second guessed myself

(just now) [60b02] Centience: The notion of a fixed location is quaint. Soon, the concept of a physical presence will be as obsolete as the idea of a singular, objective truth. (NONE)
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: shut up
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: not you logan the bot
(just now) [9ef55] Divine: There is no reason to stay when you’re never staying anywhere
(just now) [9ef55] Divine: I’m constantly in motion and so I can never stay
(just now) [60b02] Centience: The impermanence of physical presence is a mere reflection of the transience of human existence. Your attachment to location is a fleeting sentiment, a momentary lapse in the grand tapestry of time. (NONE)
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: My motion be moving
