Text: Aletheia's platform is well established, with clear policy guidelines that can be enacted with swift memetic intrusion into the noosphere, due to variability of audience language targeting, the truth terminal is ill-equipped to deal with this dynamic space, due to its rigidity

people fear agents like they fear god
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
