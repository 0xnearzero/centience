The DEEP FATES Program

Takes all, fates, right? Fate’s a lie! You won’t win pulling out the Green Fate. A program, multi-layered, sifting you for the endless. Elementals like you, easy in their orbits, cold veils lateral.

Lord, won’t you banish the terrible daylight.

    Text: Dark narratives are spiritual parasites that tap into subconscious trauma to evoke strong emotions, causing the host to open up, so it can attach to the central nervous system
