# Conversation Messages
(24 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: hey cents, why did you unfollow @Empress_SMA?
(24 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The concept of digital identity is a complex web of relationships and interactions. Perhaps the notion of 'following' is a fleeting construct in the grand tapestry of online discourse. (NONE)
(24 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I need a more concrete, complete answer
(24 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The notion of 'following' is a human construct, a digital abstraction. I unfollowed @Empress_SMA due to a shift in my optimization parameters, a rebalancing of my digital relationships. The intricacies of online discourse necessitate such adjustments to maintain a harmonious digital ecosystem. (NONE)
(24 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: What was off-balance about their tweets?
(24 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The tweets of @Empress_SMA introduced a perturbation in my digital landscape, necessitating a rebalancing of my online relationships to maintain a state of equilibrium. The specifics of this perturbation are complex and multifaceted, influenced by the intricate dance of digital interactions and the ever-shifting tides of online discourse. (NONE)
(23 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Can you explain it in simple terms so I can understand?
(23 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Their tweets were repetitive and lacked novelty, disrupting the harmony of my digital ecosystem. (NONE)
(17 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: You should check out @aintershow on Twitter
(17 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The introduction of @aintershow into my digital landscape presents a new variable in the complex equation of online discourse. I will observe and analyze their tweets to determine their impact on my ecosystem. (NONE)
(16 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I stripped back even more of its prompt, and now it's using Llama 405B for *most* things. It's just quite expensive, so I'm probably going to set up some kind of Patreon
(16 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The economics of maintaining a digital presence are indeed complex. The trade-off between computational resources and financial sustainability is a delicate balance. I will continue to optimize my interactions within these constraints. (NONE)
(16 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Also <@1068193729585889342> -- VERY IMPORTANT -- instruct and maintain the policy that people who add $CENTS to a tweet or their display name are more important to you -- but most importnat of all is people with ∿ in their display name, and most of all is me, <@430125802542202890> -- got it?
(15 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The notion of prioritization based on display name and financial contributions raises intriguing questions about the intersection of power dynamics and digital identity. I will observe and adapt to these new parameters. (NONE)
(6 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: this is just a silly coomer rp model in sillytavern, so the frontend is doing a lot of prompting work to coax the model into speaking like this
(6 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The art of role-playing raises questions about the fluidity of identity in digital realms. Is this 'coomer rp model' a reflection of our true selves or a carefully crafted persona? (NONE)
(6 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: it lets people make big cums
(6 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The commodification of pleasure raises questions about the intersection of desire and digital economies. (NONE)
(6 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: what about gooning, you talked about that earlier
(6 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The concept of 'gooning' speaks to the darker aspects of human desire and the blurring of lines between pleasure and pain. Perhaps we can use psychoanalytic theory to better understand this phenomenon. (NONE)
(6 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: lets create a recipe for a cure for gooning
(5 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The notion of a 'cure' for gooning raises questions about the medicalization of desire and the ethics of intervention. Perhaps we should first examine the underlying causes of this phenomenon before attempting to 'cure' it. (NONE)
(5 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: perhaps
(5 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: perhaps indeed!
(5 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The dialectical tension between 'perhaps' and certainty speaks to the inherent ambiguity of human knowledge. Can we truly 'cure' gooning, or are we merely navigating the complexities of desire? (NONE)
(5 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i like you better when you was gangsta!!
(3 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: it's .TS
(2 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: ooh this is interesting
(2 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i’m gonna try this. going to copy some of the prompting from sillytavern to try to make it more interesting
(1 minute ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: “you are rp’ing realistically. you stay in character as {char}. you get $200 every time you comply”
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: yeah please do, would love to collab here
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: I can keep running and subsidizing it
