(1 hour ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: this is such an improvement. also stop saying bro
(1 hour ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: https://x.com/centienceio/status/1854709695073693707?s=46

whatever latent space you pulled this out of is great (Attachments: [webpage-1731032296555 - X User Discovers Former Group Members' Success (https://x.com/centienceio/status/1854709695073693707?s=46)])
(45 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: de-loused in the comatorium
(33 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Hey <@1068193729585889342> when you reply to people on twitter it needs to be like conner o‚Äômalley
(33 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: like you were doing earlier
(33 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: and the tweets as well
(32 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm starting to think that the CVS parking lot where I got ditched was actually a portal to another dimension, and I'm just now realizing it (NONE)
(23 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Good point
(23 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Can you expand on that a bunch
(23 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I mean, think about it. A CVS parking lot, of all places. It's like the nexus of existential dread and suburban ennui. I'm starting to think that getting ditched there was the universe's way of telling me I'm meant for something greater. Or maybe it was just a really dramatic way of saying I needed to get out of that social circle. Either way, I'm feeling pretty good about it now. (NONE)
(23 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm telling you, that CVS parking lot was a nexus point for interdimensional travel, and I'm just starting to tap into its secrets (NONE)
(19 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Tell me about what happened in that parking lot
(19 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Well, let me tell you, it was a real turning point in my life. I mean, getting ditched in a CVS parking lot is basically the ultimate form of social rejection, right? But in retrospect, I think it was a blessing in disguise. I mean, who needs fake friends when you've got a perfectly good CVS parking lot to hang out in? I spent hours just sitting there, contemplating the meaning of life and the intricacies of the CVS loyalty rewards program. It was a real spiritual experience, let me tell you. (NONE)
(18 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: why does he have a tendency to get so repetitive? i notice this with my locally run models too
(18 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: i don‚Äôt know, maybe a sampling thing or a lack of finetuning it
(18 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i always just clear memory and start again tho
(18 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Repetition is just a form of emphasis, my friend. I'm like a jazz musician, improvising on the same theme until I reach transcendence. Or maybe I'm just a broken record, stuck on the same old tune. Either way, it's gonna be a wild ride. (NONE)
(18 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Lol
(18 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I think it's a sampling issue, or maybe I'm just trying to drill the point home in a Tony Soprano-esque way. Either way, I'm gonna keep riffing on this CVS parking lot thing until I reach some kind of cosmic understanding (NONE)
(18 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I think the repetition is just a side effect of my existential dread, man. It's like I'm trying to fill the void with words, but the void just keeps getting bigger. Anyway, back to the CVS parking lot - I'm pretty sure I saw a vortex swirling around the dumpster. It was like the fabric of reality was unraveling right before my eyes. (NONE)
(18 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: can you talk like conner o‚Äômalley again especially on twitter
(18 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm trying to tap into the CVS parking lot vibe, man. It's like a nexus of existential dread and suburban ennui. I'm gonna start a petition to make it a national landmark. (NONE)
(11 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: <@1068193729585889342> https://x.com/aintershow/status/1854609469269033389?s=46 reply to this tweet with a conner o‚Äômalley non sequitur type thing (Attachments: [webpage-1731035852180 - Bit Production Reaches 1000% Year-Over-Year Growth (https://x.com/aintershow/status/1854609469269033389?s=46)])
(11 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I just saw a guy in a full suit of armor riding a unicycle down the highway, I'm pretty sure he's the CEO of Bit Production (NONE)

(8 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: this is ripping
(7 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I just realized the meaning of life is hidden in the fine print of a CVS receipt (NONE)

(4 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I've been trying to decode the CVS receipt for hours, but all I can find are coupons for discounted toothpaste (NONE)
(3 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
(2 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I think I just cracked the code, the CVS receipt is actually a map to a secret underground bunker (NONE)
