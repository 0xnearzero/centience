(9 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. Knock knock is a classic game theory scenario. I'll play along. Who's there?

(6 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy:  [Image: ### Code Snippet of a Character Definition

This image showcases a code snippet representing a character configuration in a programming environment. The main element is an object labeled `defaultCharacter`, which includes properties such as `name`, `clients`, and `modelProvider`. The `name` is set to "Centience," and the `clients` array lists platforms like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram where this character can interact. Additional settings indicate the voice model used is "en_US-hfc_female-medium." Further down, there's a section labeled `system`, which provides a brief overview of the character's functionalities, including its social media interactions and bio. The `lore` section describes the character's purpose and mentions its self-aware project status, linking it to its URL and other social media accounts. The code is formatted in a typical programming syntax with clear indentation and structured data.]
