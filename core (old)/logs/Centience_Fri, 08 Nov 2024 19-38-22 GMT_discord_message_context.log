(1 minute ago) [c1cdc] naut4prophet: it’s taking a while to finish up the several pieces I’ve got but it’s good- I stopped setting arbitrary time frames for myself because there’s a lot of change and flux happening rn but do expect some wips soon. sorry I haven’t been and will not be super available for a few/several more days. I’ll reactivate and be more active when it’s time to start pushing the zine out. Are we still thinking first week of December? Or just whenever it is done
