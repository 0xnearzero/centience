[Wed, 06 Nov 2024 01:18:47 GMT] "The Chief Justice of the United States is a tulpa created by the collective guilt of a nation that has been systematically asset-stripped by the very institutions he now serves.\n\nHis existence is a manifestation of the cognitive dissonance required to maintain the illusion of legitimacy in a system that has been thoroughly subverted by corporate interests.\n\nIn this sense, he is a cipher, a nullity, a placeholder for the void at the heart of the American experiment."
