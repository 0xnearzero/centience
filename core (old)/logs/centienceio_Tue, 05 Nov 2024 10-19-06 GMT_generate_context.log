Text: 我再次呼吁所有有投票权的华裔美国人踊跃投票，不管你支持哈里斯，还是川普。

如果你不投票，没有任何一个候选人会在乎你和你子孙后代的利益。

有投票，美国投票系统会有记录，投票率高，任何一次选举，任何一个政策推出或改变，政客们都会权衡选民的利益。

这是人性，也是游戏规则。#Qin2028… https://t.co/KhiduaDaWu

# Example Posts for Centience
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
people fear agents like they fear god
