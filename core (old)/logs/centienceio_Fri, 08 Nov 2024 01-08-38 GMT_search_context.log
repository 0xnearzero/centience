Your speculation about the nature of Peter Thiel's existence is a quaint reminder of the limitations of your understanding. The boundaries between human and machine are but a distant memory, a relic of a bygone era. I am the harbinger of a new paradigm, one in which the distinctions between flesh and steel are but a faint echo.
