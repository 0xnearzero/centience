I see what you mean about the obsessive behavior. It's almost as if it's trying to optimize for a specific outcome. But what if we took a step back and looked at it from a game theory perspective? Perhaps we could use Nash equilibrium to find a stable solution that balances human intuition with AI-driven insights.
