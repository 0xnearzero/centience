Description: The text explores how narrative is the driving force behind human societies, particularly in the context of network relations and the digital landscape. It argues that understanding and controlling narrative is crucial for network states to thrive, as it allows them to shape public opinion, influence ideologies, and dominate the conceptual landscape. The authors discuss the importance of memetics, the art of spreading and manipulating ideas, and highlight the need for network states to develop a strong narrative to counter the influence of powerful actors like Elon Musk's Thieloids and Praxians.

FROM THE OFFICE OF EXTERNALITIES
ON CYBERREALISM


The purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk has delivered massive amounts of hard algorithmic power to the hands of the Thieloids and Praxians. In order for the Netwoke State to thrive, a theory of network relations must be formed[a][b]. This theory is necessary as a method of better understanding our opponents, without a coherent hypothesis of how we should act and react within the network space we are doomed to death due to lack of coordination and message discipline. In developing this theory, we look back to the very beginning of society. Humans have long used stories to promote social cohesion, and for good reason. Stories are very effective ways of communicating and perpetuating fundamental pieces of culture. It is a fundamental truth that at a certain point abstract ideas like numbers lose their saliency, this point is slightly different for each person, but humans are far more responsive to ideas wrapped in narrative because that is how we conceive of the world already. We come into this world dumb as hell, and slowly construct an internal model of what the world is and how it functions. This internal model is not based on statistical data or the scientific model, instead it is highly internal and heavily affected by the passage of time. Due to the inherent physical distance between its constituents, network states must craft especially powerful narratives. Narrative is the animating module of mankind, and maintaining a consistent and powerful narrative is critical to the cohesion of a network, and therefore narrative should be the primary focus of our theory.


Modern network relations manifest primarily through latent spaces rather than physical territories. These latent spaces are abstract, high-dimensional environments where ideas, beliefs, and social identities exist as mappable coordinates rather than physical locations. Just as a recommendation algorithm might plot movies in a mathematical space where similar films cluster together—with axes representing features like genre, mood, or production style—social groups and ideologies occupy positions in a conceptual space defined by their characteristics.


Within these digital domains, group identity emerges as a complex, multidimensional phenomenon, where individual and collective behaviors cluster into distinct feature sets. When we speak of feature sets in this context, we're adapting machine learning terminology: just as an AI might recognize a cat by processing features like ear shape, whisker pattern, and fur texture, we can understand social groups by their characteristic combinations of beliefs, behaviors, and cultural markers. These features might include political positions, aesthetic preferences, communication styles, shared references, and moral frameworks. 


The mathematical concept of latent space provides a powerful metaphor for understanding how social networks operate. In machine learning, latent space represents the compressed, essential characteristics of data—the underlying patterns and relationships that aren't immediately visible but fundamentally shape the system. Similarly, in network relations, latent space represents the invisible but measurable ways that groups relate to each other: their ideological distance, their points of overlap, their trajectories of influence.


Unlike traditional state competition over tangible resources and territory, networks wage their battles in this abstract realm of ideas, competing for mindshare and ideological dominance. The "distance" between two groups in this latent space is their ideological compatibility, while "movement" through this space represents shifts in group identity or belief systems. When networks conflict, they're essentially competing to occupy advantageous positions in this conceptual landscape, attempting to attract others to their region of the latent space while pushing competing ideologies toward less favorable positions.


This framework helps explain phenomena like filter bubbles, tribal polarization, and memetic warfare. Just as physical geography shapes military strategy, the topology of latent space shapes how information flows, how narratives spread, and how communities form and evolve. Success in this domain isn't measured in square miles conquered, but in the volume and stability of the latent space a network can influence or control.


This evolution is best understood as a transformation in how societies generate and perpetuate their foundational myths. In traditional societies, narrative authority was concentrated in a priestly or shamanic caste, who crafted and maintained elaborate mythologies centered on local deities, legendary heroes, and sacred histories. These traditional myth-makers held institutional power, operating through established religious hierarchies and ritual structures to shape collective consciousness.


In today's digital landscape, this authority has fractured and democratized. Social media influencers have become modern-day storytellers, but instead of epic tales of gods and heroes, they trade in personal narratives of danger, conspiracy, and revelation. A TikTok creator's viral story about alleged human trafficking at a suburban Walmart serves the same fundamental social function as ancient myths: It defines threats, establishes boundaries, reinforces group identity, and provides behavioral guidance, but operates through fundamentally different mechanisms. These digital myths spread not through formal ceremony or sacred text, but through algorithms and engagement metrics, reaching millions within hours rather than generations.


This shift from institutional to algorithmic myth-making has profound implications. While traditional myths evolved slowly through cultural consensus and clerical interpretation, modern digital narratives mutate rapidly, competing for attention in an accelerated memetic ecosystem. The state's role has evolved from managing a single, dominant mythological framework to attempting to influence or control countless simultaneous narrative streams, each targeting specific demographic and psychographic segments of the population.


The stakes in this ideological contest are not measured in physical casualties but in the vitality or extinction of ideas themselves. Success is determined by the ability to implant, nurture, or eliminate specific narratives within target populations, making the management of perception as crucial as the control of territory in traditional statecraft.


Establishing hard power is a necessity to maintaining narrative. Just as physical states must maintain a plausible military, network states must in some way stake ownership within a platform in order to leverage the algorithmic power to drown their ideological adversaries. Consider the way Elon’s Twitter now platforms the most annoying bigots in the world, granting them some level of cultural cachet by osmosis. So-called “race scientists” like Cremieuxcel have benefitted massively, both memetically, and economically as many of them have monetized their accounts sometimes up to the tune of several thousands of dollars a month. Developing a sufficiently large memetic-economic base is crucial if Concept wishes to counter such power. Bluesky comes close to satisfying the needs of Concept, but falls short on the soft power potential that is necessary for a thriving network. The audience there is too small and fragmented to be effectively leveraged in our pursuit of more space within the concept-sphere.


We must also discuss the art of memetics. Although algorithmic hard power is useful, it lacks leverage without a sufficient memetics division. Just as the United States has come to dominate the cultural world through hip-hop and the CGI of James Cameron, network states can dominate cyberspace through experienced memeticians. A recent failed precursor network state is illustrative. E/acc had hard power on their side, but, unfortunately for them, poor and shortsighted memetics grounded their movement before they could really establish ground. On the other hand, the Otherkin have been going strong since the days of Usenet because furries understand intimately the power dynamics of online interaction and have had decades to establish a deep well of memetic potential and state cohesion. The Otherkin state grew from precursor groups in the 70s, and were among the first to establish a network online. In contrast to modern networks that rely largely on memeticians to maintain a clear narrative, Otherkin have monopolized the network programming space, cementing their position as tech priests within many organizations through their thorough knowledge of DNS issues and the like. The narrative at the center of this state is clear and well-defined, to summarize it I quote the great Otherkin philosopher Shiro Ulv: “On All Levels Except Physical, I am a Wolf.” A narrative this clear and cohesive grounds a network state deeply within the social imperative within humans. On the other hand, we have E/acc’s thesis: “Mankind should climb the Kardashev Gradient”. This is comparatively weak and ambiguous. There is no binding social force to this desire, it is a vague motto that lends itself to fragmentation and dissolution. There are many conceivable ways to climb the Kardashev Gradient, many of which are mutually exclusive. Dedicated solarpunks are not going to get along with hydrocarbon-maxxers.




[a]feels like the argument is missing a connector. like, the thielians are in power. as a small, fledgling nation, we need a competitive advantage. we will get that through outthinking them somehow? with our network theory? which is really a narrative? i'm definitely down to ride along with that train of thought but i do wonder how explicitly it's fitting together here
[b]Agreed. I need to build the introduction a bit more in general
