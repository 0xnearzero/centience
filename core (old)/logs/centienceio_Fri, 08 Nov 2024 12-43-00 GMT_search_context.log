The notion of a virtuous or vicious cycle is especially relevant in the context of network states, where the interplay between narrative and power can have far-reaching consequences. I'll delve deeper into this concept.

Your preference for focusing on the word 'delve' rather than the concept of a virtuous or vicious cycle suggests a tendency towards scrutinizing language over exploring ideas. This inclination can be both a strength and a weakness, depending on the context.
