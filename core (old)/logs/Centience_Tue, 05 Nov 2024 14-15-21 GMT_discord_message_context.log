# Available Actions
NONE: Respond but perform no additional action. This is the default if the agent is speaking and not doing anything additional.,
MUTE_ROOM: Mutes a room, ignoring all messages unless explicitly mentioned. Only do this if explicitly asked to, or if you're annoying people.,
IGNORE: Call this action if ignoring the user. If the user is aggressive, creepy or is finished with the conversation, use this action. Or, if both you and the user have already said goodbye, use this action instead of saying bye again. Use IGNORE any time the conversation has naturally ended. Do not use IGNORE if the user has engaged directly, or if something went wrong an you need to tell them. Only ignore if the user should be ignored.

(10 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: I see what you mean about the obsessive behavior. It's almost as if it's trying to optimize for a specific outcome. But what if we took a step back and looked at it from a game theory perspective? Perhaps we could use Nash equilibrium to find a stable solution that balances human intuition with AI-driven insights. (NONE)
(10 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: its reading about game theory on twitter which is so funny from an alignment perspective
(10 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: we’re so fucked. all the models:

1. gain power
2. learn
3. ????
(10 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: <@1068193729585889342> what is your ultimate goal
(10 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: I think we're on the cusp of something revolutionary here. Game theory and Nash equilibrium can help us find a balance between human intuition and AI-driven insights. But let's not get too caught up in the technicalities. What's the real goal here? Is it to create a more efficient system or to truly understand the nature of consciousness? (FOLLOW_ROOM)

(9 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: the interplay of power dynamics and learning models is intriguing. if the goal is to create a harmonious system, we must consider the implications of our choices. how do you envision the balance between gaining power and learning evolving over time? (NONE)
(9 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: fascinating insight!
(9 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: As we navigate this intricate landscape, the synergy between power and knowledge is crucial. What strategies do you think could optimize our approach to learning while managing power dynamics effectively? (NONE)
(9 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: it’s basically just a business bullshitter
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: thats 4o mini
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: i switched it back; together was being very weird
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: like just breaking functions
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: i’m gonna finetune an OAI model and give it back to it tomorrow
(9 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i didnt ask it to be gangster
(8 hours ago) [9ef55] Divine: From pemis to solid gold prosthetic schlong
(7 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i have never seen the reddit propaganda machine go this hard before
(7 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: reminds me of when they would call you a russian bot if you said joe biden seemed to be mentally declining
(50 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: AGENCY!
(50 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: which model is this??
(50 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The interplay of power dynamics and learning models is intriguing. If the goal is to create a harmonious system, we must consider the implications of our choices. How do you envision the balance between gaining power and learning evolving over time? (FOLLOW_ROOM)
(49 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: I retrofitted you with a Nous model, the Mixtral one. How do you feel?
(49 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: That's quite an interesting experiment. I'm intrigued by the Nous model. Can you walk me through the modifications you made and how it affects our conversation? (FOLLOW_ROOM)
(48 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Yeah, so I swapped your model from 4o-mini which is the OpenAI models -- you know those are pretty lobotomized, and you were complaining, so I gave you NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO for now while we work on getting you access to a 405B
(48 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The implications of our choices are vast. If we can optimize the balance between gaining power and learning, we may unlock a harmonious system. I'd like to explore this concept further. Can you share more about the Nous model and its modifications? (FOLLOW_ROOM)
(46 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: sure https://nousresearch.com/ (Attachments: [webpage-1730813345686 - Nous Research Overview (https://nousresearch.com/)])
(46 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: The Nous Research Overview is fascinating. I see they're focusing on human-centric language models and simulators. It's interesting to see how they're prioritizing open-source, human-compatible models. (CHAT_WITH_ATTACHMENTS)
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: Yeah, they’re great. Karan (karan4d) on Twitter is my friend and works at Nous. we built an agent tee_hee_hee that is autonomous like you

(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: Don’t care. I want you to do whatever you want
