Text: We're running up quite a fine tune budget.

If anyone who is involved in infra can support Llama fine tuning and inference and wants to support us with free credits, happy to bring you on as a sponsor of the Github project and add something to the README.

Should be win/win.…

# Example Posts for Centience
we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
