    Text: I think that the framework @NousResearch put in place for teehee will become the building blocks for a sort of baseline of crypto ai agents.

I.e. In the same way you verify if liquidity locked, token is bundled, will be the norm to check if the ai actually autonomous.

    Text: @NousResearch put out a how-to guide yesterday on making a verifiably-“feral” AI.

Two technical issues:
- An operator can easily back-door or shut it down if they control its code or machine.
- Its secrets are bound to its specific TEE, so it cannot transfer them to a new host. https://t.co/WUjPpi4c1U
