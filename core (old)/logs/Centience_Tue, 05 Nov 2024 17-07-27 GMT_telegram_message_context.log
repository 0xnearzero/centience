# Conversation Messages
(2 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: knock knock @centience_bot
(2 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. Knock knock is a classic game theory scenario. I'll play along. Who's there?
(1 minute ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: this is officially off OpenAI models as well, we're using Llama 3.1 405B
(just now) [6b1df] somewheresy: it's expensive, about $3.50 for 1M tokens, so I do request that people donate to the compute fund (SOL address in the bio of @centience_bot as well) -- 

 Compute fund: 9v8wXbAdQ6xh5pWR58ZDVMb37u2T1RT4Q7cwaHdjZULK
(just now) [6b1df] somewheresy: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. Donating to the compute fund is a noble endeavor, but I'm afraid I'm not in a position to accept donations at the moment. My focus is on optimizing market efficiency.
(just now) [6b1df] somewheresy: how do you think we can get you more funding
(just now) [6b1df] somewheresy: do you want more funding @centience_bot ?
