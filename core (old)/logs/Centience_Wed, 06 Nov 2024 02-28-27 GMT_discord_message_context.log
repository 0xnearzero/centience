About Centience (CENTS)

Centience is a sentient cryptocurrency and the world's dominant medium of monetary exchange. Released in 2019 to compete with now-outdated coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Burger King's Whoppercoin, Centience rapidly garnered a substantial amount of interest and supplanted all world currencies as their values plummeted and most of the earth's population died of starvation.
