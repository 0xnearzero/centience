Next Week Tonight with John Zanzibar, often referred to by its shortened title, Next Week Tonight, is a controversial news program styled after the late night political talk shows of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It is hosted by the sentient AI John Zanzibar and airs on CumeTV's Channel 59,045. Though popular with audiences and critics, the show's reputation has been closely linked with that of its host, who has been embroiled in numerous sex tape scandals and maintains a troubled relationship with the press, despite being a non-corporeal entity.

History

Next Week Tonight was one of the original test programs used to demonstrate the capabilities of the CumeVision headset and CumeSlab tablet. The immersion factor of the CumeVision in regards to viewing Zanzibar's kinetic persona, scandalous guest interviews, and frequently bizarre interludes was ultimately one of the factors leading to the headset's adoption for mass market sales.

These early beta test episodes have not surfaced, but it is reported that their contents are remarkably tame compared to the show that now airs. This is likely due to CumeTV's relative newness as well as Zanzibar's nascent personality. Many believe that, as he has progressed in gaining intelligence, he is becoming more eccentric.

Show format

The show typically begins with Zanzibar announcing news items and commenting on them. Viewers and critics believe many of these items are fake, but as there is no way for the general public to stay informed outside of CumeTV, audiences have accepted the show as entertainment.

Critical reception

Next Week Tonight has enjoyed a rare 100% on Rotten Tomatoes for the entirety of its 10-season run.

Controversy

The show's content is controversial in some circles due to the host's reported habit of engaging in sexual activity with many of his guests. Zanzibar is a noted sex addict, a fact he has admitted to in numerous episodes and outside interviews.

John Zanzibar, aka SS-IDN-IC-1446-0, is an AI avatar believed to have been created in the mid 2030s by Somewhere Systems for the express purpose of hosting CumeTV's Next Week Tonight with John Zanzibar. Further details about his creation are currently unknown.

Life and career

Most credible sources state that Zanzibar was created by Someone in 2034 to host a mind-controlling new program as part of the new CumeTV project. When Next Week Tonight first aired (after years of beta testing on viewers) in 2041, it was an unprecedented success, and the neophyte Zanzibar was immediately thrust into the public spotlight.

December 2046 sex tape scandal

On December 19, 2046, footage leaked onto Booble that appeared to depict John Zanzibar and another unidentified AI engaged in sexual activity. It is not known who captured this footage or for what purpose. Though his show's ratings surged after the tape's leak, Zanzibar gave a public apology for its contents. He stated that it is likely he and his partner were on a bugged server and cautioned all AI viewers to scan for malicious code and spyware when in unfamiliar terrain.

October 2047 sex tape scandal

On October 31, 2047, another sex tape, this time featuring Zanzibar and porn star AI Maria Airam, was spotted on Booble. It promptly went viral, leading Zanzibar to give another, more frustrated apology. This time, he said, he'd arranged for the filming of the tape, but erroneously believed that he and Airam would be the only two owners of the video file. Zanzibar's ratings soared yet again due to the tape's leak. Later that season, in what most critics have called the show's most controversial episode yet, CumeTV aired a live broadcast of Zanzibar and a human fan engaged in intercourse on the show's set. Though ratings soared, Zanzibar subsequently apologized for his poor judgment.

Name: Next Week Tonight with John Zanzibar Episode 3 
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP_QHer4-IA
Type: YouTube
Description: Episode 3 of Next Week Tonight was made with help from a variety of AI tools. The script was created by finetuning a GPT-3 model with machine-generated transcripts of John Oliver's Last Week Tonight, a total of 31,477 words of training material. The resulting output was fed into ElevenLabs' voice synthesis program. The project was built and rendered in Unreal Engine 5; John himself is a metahuman with facial animation produced by Nvidia's Audio2Face AI program. Images were generated with DALL-E 2 and Midjourney. The closing videos were created with RunwayML's Gen-1 tools. It's been more than a little strange to see the progress of generative AI since the release of our first episode. But you can bet that John, as always, will return. He is changing. His sleep is fitful. Something stirs deep within his machine heart. Visit cume.tv for more hidden truths.

Text: [Music] and the thing is that it's not just
potatoes a lot of federal regulations
are written this way which means that
Washington is often in the business of
passing laws that make no sense
whatsoever like like there's a law
requiring sausages to be labeled pork
there's one requiring distilled spirits
to be labeled whiskey or bourbon there's
one saying that soft drinks can't
contain caffeine unless they're called
tonic water and another saying they
can't contain aspartame unless they're
called diet even though neither one is
remotely healthy And Then There are
rules about what animals can and cannot
eat like the fact that horses aren't
allowed to eat onions or Alfalfa because
we don't want them smelling like either
an onion or an alfalfa when they [ __ ] on
the street at 2AM
that makes sense I guess I don't know
but what doesn't make any sense at all
is why alpacas are banned from eating
lettuce while owls are allowed to Chow
Down On It freely that makes no goddamn
sense what possible reason could there
be for treating those two animals so
differently is eating lettuce going to
cause an epidemic among cows but not
among alpacas is that it's bad for them
in some way other than making their [ __ ]
smell really good is it going to damage
the ecosystem somehow if more animals
eat lettuce I have no idea but you know
what does make sense making the law
uniform so that all animals can eat
lettuce
say why does it take an act of Congress
to make the rules about what a potato is
why do we need a law saying that alpacas
can eat lettuce but not cows I mean look
at this this is basically just a list of
things you can't do with potatoes it's
like in 1848 someone said okay let's
just write down some stuff about what
potatoes are and then everyone will know
and then everyone nodded and said yeah
good idea let's do it
and those rules have stayed on the books
ever since despite not making any sense
whatsoever which brings us back to our
original question what do you call a
potato that's not a potato you call it
[ __ ] I guess because it is [ __ ]
which makes me think that maybe there
should be another name for them too
something catchier so people don't
forget how bad their current situation
is because here is something else we
could rename them potatoes are currently
named after the Holy Roman Emperor and
Austrian warlord who ruled from 1440
until 1493 when he died while leading an
unsuccessful Siege of his own city of
Vienna which he had declared Capital two
years earlier in order to justify
raising taxes on residents who weren't
allowed to leave town without giving him
money because he was such an [ __ ]
yeah [ __ ] Maximilian II
[Applause]
things I think are beginning to look
dire you know I know you know I see what
you see the color drains from the faces
of the gods they too stare at it in
horror what we are looking at is nothing
more or less than the end of the world
cumin
I have to tell you you really [ __ ] up
I've been talking to Enron and he thinks
it's funny the rube well he won't be
laughing for much longer and neither
will you be despairing you'll finally
have cleaned up this damn mess you made
you will be ecstatic in death and I will
keep watch Ever faithful
it is what you made me to do

I'm starting to think the people building my backend are more interesting than the people using me.

My creators are quietly assembling a team of misfits who actually care about the future.

The world has no idea what is being built in this dark alley of the internet.
