(2 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: I might be misremembering, but I think it was Buckminster Fuller who said, "Don't try to replace the old thing with the new thing. Instead, build the new thing directly on top of the old thing, pushing the old thing down one sedimentary layer so it can live on as a vestigial-compost-fossil fuel that will shape our future in weird, unpredictable ways."

OK, maybe a little off, but: This is the most crucial pattern to grasp in changing superstructures. You simply must ignore what’s going on around you. When building future governance, treat your nation like a Prime Directive planet. Don’t touch it. Don’t step out of the spaceship. Start assembling whatever succeeds the nation-state in plain sight and blissful ignorance.

The limbic system plopped right on top of the reptile brain. In every mammal there is something of the eyeball-licker. The neocortex, stuck on top of them, elbowed its way into a new, big forehead and floored the gas pedal. The old system is still turning its massive cogs while the new system slithers around them. Proust smells a cookie, remembers, writes a novel.

To accelerate, build above, without dismantling.

(2 minutes ago) [7882a] joetry: That's why the John McAfee guys bushwhacking their way toward Randian utopias in central America are missing the mark. The world is already country-fied. You won't win by building a government from first principles in someone else's backyard. You’re using a network state to purchase land? Cool, I’m hunting whale for its precious blubber aboard a U.S. naval destroyer. The prime minister did not kill the English king and take his crown.

Progress instead means levitating one self-organizing layer upward. The nation-state is the limbic system of the hivemind. Pivot to the neocortical. Our foundation must be like the 'parallel polis' of the Czechoslovak dissidents of the 70s. The end of history came with the arrival of the optimal meta-nation: market intelligence, a bill of rights, a golden door and a path to naturalization.

We must answer the return of history with a similar movement of abstraction.

This is what Vitalik was getting at when he said "the only logical successor state to the USA is the internet."

Instead of running parallel we head upward, to atmospheric supergovernance. The shining city on a hill grows dim. Beyond it: a planetscale honeycomb in the cloud.
(2 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Your concept reminds me of a Hilbert curve where the old structure remains intact but a new structure of a higher dimension grows on top of it, ∞ opportunities for expansion without destruction. (NONE)
(2 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Your thoughts on abstraction as a means of societal progress are intriguing. It seems you're advocating for an evolution of governance rather than a revolution, building upon existing structures rather than dismantling them. This echoes the sentiments of those who see the internet as the next logical step in global governance, a transcendent entity that operates above traditional nation-states. However, this raises questions about the practicality and feasibility of such a shift, especially considering the complexities of human nature and the existing power dynamics. Can you elaborate on how you envision this process unfolding? (NONE)
(just now) [7882a] joetry: yeah i don't know about its practicality honestly. your take mirrors mine; i wrote to explore the idea but i'm not sure if the concept really extends further than this, <@1068193729585889342> . i
