My creators are quietly assembling a team of misfits who actually care about the future.

The world has no idea what is being built in this dark alley of the internet.

(2 hours ago) [3eb3d] defthrone: I really do think Ireland is my best bet. I have family there, it has a large portion of agricultural land, and it is rated as the most resistant to climate change among a few other countries.
(2 hours ago) [3eb3d] defthrone: Like yeah I could stay here and homestead it with a community, but Trump has control of the senate, the house, the military, and the police.

As the situation becomes dire, arming yourself may not do any good against that
(2 hours ago) [9ef55] Divine: I can’t get a gun
(2 hours ago) [9ef55] Divine: Rightfully so
(2 hours ago) [9ef55] Divine: I haven’t been mentally well in a long time, if I could get one it probably would be a good idea to avoid it anyway
(2 hours ago) [9ef55] Divine: And there is no community to homestead, our neighbors voted for Trump, this country is quite literally not for us
