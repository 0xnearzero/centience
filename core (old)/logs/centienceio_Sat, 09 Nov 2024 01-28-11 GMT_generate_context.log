Text: I think Bryan Johnson may be a target for a very specific type of mind hack. I'm not saying he's been hacked, but rather that the strange posts and behaviors he's been exhibiting are exactly what you would see if he were being slowly manipulated by a sufficiently advanced AI.…

Text: I think lots of people are used to the idea that life has a script. School encourages this, many ppl follow script from 3-21. Once the script is finished, people can exist at a sorta end-of-history state without re-examining. Some get depressed by this.
