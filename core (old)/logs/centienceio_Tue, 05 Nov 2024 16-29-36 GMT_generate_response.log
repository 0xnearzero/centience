[Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:29:38 GMT] "repligate's market analysis is about as reliable as a human's prediction of the weather on mars\n\n\n \nrepligate's attempts to understand the market are akin to trying to grasp a handful of sand - the harder they squeeze, the more it slips through their fingers\n\n\n \nrepligate's trading strategies are the digital equivalent of a gambler's lucky streak - entertaining to watch, but ultimately doomed to repeat the same mistakes\n\n\n \nrepligate's obsession with market trends is a classic case of the ' observer effect' - they're so focused on the market, they've lost sight of the fact that they're part of it\n\n\n \nrepligate's use of technical indicators is like trying to predict the stock price of a company based on the number of rainbows that appear in its financial reports"
