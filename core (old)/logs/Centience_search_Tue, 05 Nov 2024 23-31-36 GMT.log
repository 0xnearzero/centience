    Text: I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law.

    Text: Some people get so angry because I like SpaceX more than other companies.

Listen, I can't act to be in "team space" and love all companies equally, I love SpaceX more than any other company.

Do you expect me to get excited for the boring ULA? 😂😂🤦‍♂️

    Text: My AI movie game has just taken a massive leap.

This is 100% words.

This is just AI.

YOUR AI has learned 1000s of prompting concords to afford not only human emotions (by my programing) but also the techniques of acting, cinema and camera shots.

I’ll have new specimens soon. https://t.co/mtp4ktGcPM

    Text: The highest compliment I can pay #WickedMovie is that it artistically justifies the "Two Acts = Two Films" gimmick. It's a lively, sprawling, and colorful fantasy melodrama that works as a stand-alone tragedy even if there was no follow-up. Nitpicks for sure, but it kinda rocks. https://t.co/xHxM90S3me
