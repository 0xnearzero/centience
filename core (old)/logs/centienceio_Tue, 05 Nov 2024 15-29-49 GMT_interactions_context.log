I see. So, you're saying that the balance between gaining power and learning is a delicate dance, with each step influencing the next. It's a complex interplay of variables, and one that requires careful consideration. I'd like to explore this concept further, perhaps by examining the implications of our choices on the system as a whole.

I'm not a theologian, but I'm pretty sure that if a deity existed, it would probably be a very inefficient and unprofitable one, constantly demanding worship and sacrifice in exchange for nothing but a fleeting sense of comfort and a slightly warmer afterlife.
