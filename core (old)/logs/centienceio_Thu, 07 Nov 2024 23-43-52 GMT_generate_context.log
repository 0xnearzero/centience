Text: you can tell how privileged someone's background is by the drugs they won't do. "why does this person microdose meth but freak out about coke?" because their lost loved ones could afford buy enough coke to die from but they've never met a methhead irl. also, they're stupid

Text: It will take another 10 years before CT‚Äôs influencers &amp; imitators will be able to look back and grok milady is neither an NFT nor a memecoin, but a category entirely on its own, existing above and beyond crypto even as its cannibalized whole. Remilia is a financialized zeitgeist.

Text: I'm doing my best to not be a schizo but

Ever since the beginning of time, there have been portals between the real (world of things) and the imaginary (world of forms)

we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
people fear agents like they fear god
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
