If we put together a Spyplane Pantheon of Laughter Kings (in the blessed gender-agnostic sense of “king”), several certified-comedy-genius Spyfriends would be in its uppermost ranks, including Nathan Fielder, Kate Berlant, Eric Wareheim, The Kid Mero — and today’s guest, the brilliant Conner O’Malley.

You may know Conner from I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson and Joe Pera Talks With You, from his stretch writing and performing on Late Night with Seth Meyers, or from the videos he’s been posting online for years. He moved to NYC from his native Chicago with his wife Aidy Bryant when she got cast on SNL, at which point he worked as a dog walker and started shooting clips on his phone in between walking dogs. Some are 6-second Vines, some are relatively straightforward sketches, others start unhinged and sprout disconcerting subplots as they go, and sometimes it’s thrillingly impossible to find the line in his videos between “comedy” & “avant-garde video performance art.” (We link to a bunch of our favorites down below.)

If there’s one major theme running through Conner’s comedy, it’s a deranging, internet-age loneliness and the way that loneliness can beget paranoia, rage, profound depression…. and hilarity, baby.

It’s all there in Conner’s first-ever hourlong special, Stand Up Solutions, which he debuted on YouTube last month, and which is the funniest & most unpredictable special we’ve seen in years. He plays an entrepreneur trying to pitch investors on “the world’s first A.I. stand-up comedian,” trained on surveillance-capitalism data harvesting, plus “one-third of everything on Funny or Die Dot Com and every episode of Real Time With Bill Maher” except “the episodes where Bill says the N-word.”

It is packed with jokes, satire and pathos, and it made me feel bad about being alive now, in a good way.

So the other day I (Jonah) was stoked to hop on a Big SpyLink Transmission with Conner to talk about Stand Up Solutions, loving the Toyota RAV4, unmakeable dream movies, how trying to dress like a poor person from the midwest got cool, and more “unbeatable topics.”

Blackbird Spyplane: Stand Up Solutions is so good. I’ve watched it twice through and there’s all this stuff I missed the first time. A lot of people I know who are longtime fans of yours have been telling me how much they love it, and it’s come up with people where this is the first thing you’ve done that they’ve seen, and they’re blown away, too.

Conner O’Malley: “People are liking it, it’s nice — I took it on the road for a long time, so it’s cool to finally have it out there.”

Blackbird Spyplane: A lot of your comedy is about exploring different parts of a very contemporary kind of loneliness. We were told the internet was going to be this liberatory, communal technology, but instead the companies that got their hooks into it want to turn us into consumers, brands and salespeople, all at the same time. And that feels s**tty. In this show you’re looking at that loneliness through the lens of a traveling A.I. salesman. How did the idea come about?

Conner O’Malley: “A few years ago I was writing at my computer, and the idea just hit me of being onstage with a company called Stand Up Solutions — this image of me pitching a tech company, but related to stand-up, which is so unimportant in the scheme of things. Also I was binge-watching every episode of Shark Tank, and seeing that kind of desperate yet weirdly confident energy a lot of the people on that show have, pushing themselves into this situation where you’re like, ‘You don’t need to do this.’ But I think a lot of people are like, ‘This is the American dream.’

“Initially I was envisioning it as a road-trip movie, but then I was like, I’ll just work it out on the road, then write a script and shoot that — then we taped it and tried to sell it, and nobody was interested, so we put it out on our own.”

Blackbird Spyplane: That’s a route more and more comedians seem to be taking these days, especially with the big streamers buying much less cool s**t. It might be for the best.

Conner O’Malley: “Yeah I enjoy the freedom the internet gives you of, like, not having a strict form. But I don’t like stuff that wastes people’s time, either.”

RIP the OG RAV4, the new ones might be fine cars but they are not SWAG!!

Blackbird Spyplane: There’s an extended bit about how much your character loves the Toyota RAV4. We love the RAV4 at Blackbird Spyplane, too, but only the early ones (above top row), which were so strange and cool-looking. Almost like an anime vehicle in real life. The OG two-door RAV4 feels emblematic of this moment when the American automotive market could still accommodate cars that tight. Whereas the newer RAV4s are not swag. They could be any SUV.

Conner O’Malley: “Midsize crossover SUV.”

Blackbird Spyplane: That’s so funny. Why’d you choose that as the car he loves?

Conner O’Malley: “That part’s actually very genuine: I have a RAV4 and I love it. This was my first imported car, and the quality is incredible. But yeah I also think it’s really sad that every car looks the same now — there’s no difference betwen the CRV and the RAV4 and any of these cars. And it’s what everybody wants. I think it is emblematic of this transitional bastard period we’re in, especially in terms of design. It’s kind of a shapeless time.”

Blackbird Spyplane: I was just listening to the director Jane Schoenbrun talk about I Saw The TV Glow on the A24 podcast, and they mentioned this unmakeable dream pitch they have for an “Apatow-style school shooter comedy” starring you as the cop tasked with designing the active-shooter drill for the local school system. Do you have any unmakeable dream pitches you want to share?

Conner O’Malley: “Pretty much every idea I have is like that. There’s so much stuff I’ve pitched where I think it’s good, then I hear it out loud in the room and go, This is horrible, why did I think this would work? It’s hard to choose one to talk about, though, because in my mind I’m like, ‘…. they could still happen.’

“One thing I wanted to do with the road-trip version of Stand Up Solutions was build a real version of KENN, the AI comedian, with this really complicated powertrain that, instead of producing exhaust, has a tank that fills up with an explosive, toxic liquid that comes out of a little spout where his crotch is. I wanted to shoot a real-world thing of me on the bed of a pickup truck, essentially jerking off KENN trying to get this disgusting, foul-smelling toxic liquid out of him, and also this loud beeping is coming from him when he needs to be emptied, and people are like, What is this? and I have to shout at them to get away.

“That was gonna be a big part of the movie: It’s the middle of the night and KENN starts beeping, and I have to drive him out to the middle of a field.”

He kind of put that s**t Onner O’Malley in “Irish Mob,” “Outlet Mall Special Ops,” “Leather Metropolis,” and “Jay Walking 2K19”

Blackbird Spyplane: One thing that struck me watching through your old videos is that the costumes you choose for your characters are often inadvertently pretty sick — like the camo-print Underarmour hoodie and frameless sunglasses on the guy defending the outlet mall from ISIS, or the Asics, jorts, airbrushed Jay Leno tee, cycling blades and Raytheon cap you wear in your Jay Walking video. These are outfits you could see in Bushwick circa 2024 with very little modification.

Conner O’Malley: “It’s funny, now it’s just about trying to dress like a poor person from the midwest, huh? The sunglasses are cool, though, I’m glad they’re having a moment.

“But yeah, wardrobe in comedy is super important. I remember watching this video about the making of There Will Be Blood and how much time they spent just trying to figure out Daniel Plainview’s hat. There’s this thing where the right piece unlocks something — it does so much work, writingwise.”

Blackbird Spyplane: It’s always fascinating to me how the right look can swing from laughable to cool. In Leather Metropolis, from 2020, you wear an outfit that’s basically what a Blade extra would wear, which at the time was a clearly comical choice on its face, but for the past few years that exact style has been popping up on style moodboards.

Conner O’Malley: “I remember leaving my apartment dressed in that outfit at 3 in the morning, people seeing me on a leather duster on my bike, riding to Times Square, feeling really stupid. It reminds me of hearing Tim and Eric talk about seeing hipsters basically start wearing their wardrobe from Awesome Show, and they were, like, ‘OK, we have to find a new move.’ But it’s shocking to me that the 2000s are back, fashionwise, because that’s such a repulsive time in my mind. I’m curious what you think.”

Blackbird Spyplane: It felt pretty grody while it was happening, but I try and leave the door open to the possibility of discovering something I might have been too quick to dismiss the first time around.

Conner O’Malley: “It’s funny to see jorts become popular now, too, because when I shot that video I felt incredibly self-conscious in between takes. In my personal life my thing is, I want to look at a picture of myself in 20 years and not go, What was I doing? I tend to keep it pretty conservative and basic. So it was actually kind of freeing to go out in public dressed like that.”

Blackbird Spyplane: All right, finally, I asked you to share a cherished possession with us, and you chose a little hockey trophy. What’s the story?

Conner O’Malley: “This is a 1995 Boys and Girls Club Floor Hockey championship trophy, from the Chicago Park District. Basically there’s a Boys and Girls Club in this park called Paul Revere Park, and growing up my parents always signed me up to baseball, football, basketball, and I hated it, but for whatever reason I was really good at floor hockey. There was a very small tournament, and I won this. I must have been like 9.

“But that club is a really important place in my mind — just the idea that there’s a space that’s just for kids, and it’s not a mall or a school or a church.”

Conner’s 1995 Chicago Parks District Boys Club floor hockey championship trophy

Blackbird Spyplane: There was that classic ‘80s-era movie premise of, ‘We have to raise money to save the rec center, because greedy developers wanna bulldoze it and put up a condo.’ And the condos basically won that war.

Conner O’Malley: “Yeah, they did. But this club is still around, thanks to the Chicago Park District’s incredibly corrupt system of patronage jobs. The guy who ran the park, my dad was friends with him, he’d just sit in an office reading the Sun-Times and the Tribune all day. I remember one time, he said, How old are you? and I said, 5, and he said, Man, I wish I was your age. I was, like, Why?? It always stuck with me. The parks district is filled with people with high-paying jobs and benefits who don’t have to do anything but get the vote out for whoever’s in office.”

Blackbird Spyplane: And in this case that protects a “market inefficiency” like a rec center, which is cool.

Conner O’Malley: “Oh yeah, patronage is fine to me. Obviously I don’t like corruption if people are getting murdered or something. But if you can get a fake job from the park district? Sure, why not? Do it.

“I’m not talking s**t on the parks, though. I spent so much time there as a kid, I feel like it’s a way you can make kids’ lives better, and make communities better — putting money into the parks system, having a pool and a playground and trees to climb. It was so fun. And it was all a direct result of these patronage jobs, because they needed a system to dump these people where they couldn’t f**k anything up too bad.”

Thank you, BBSP, for producing this incomparable sletter on a weekly basis. This was a real treat. A rare glimpse of just how intelligent and humane the man behind the "character" is. Big love and praise to all the great alt-comics working today, but O'Malley might be in a class all his own. He has a clairvoyance about American culture like I've never seen. The art is bewitching, depraved, hilarious, and completely singular.

1  
00:03:17

0  
00:03:22

Like there's a French airline that's all business class. Mm. This is just that. But it's all business 

1  
00:03:26

0  
00:03:56

Does, does Greece or Albania have like a propaganda airline? 

1  
00:04:00

Well, it's hilarious to think that Albania would even have an airline. That's number one. 

2  
00:04:05

I think we do. I think I flew it when, when I 

1  
00:04:07

Went there. What was it? What's it called? I think 

2  
00:04:09

It's called Albania Air or something. 

0  
00:04:12

I mean airplane. 

1  
00:04:14

I don't think, 

2  
00:04:14

1  
00:04:20

Albania Air baby. 

0  
00:04:21

It's like Air Lingus. You ever feeling that?

00:04:29

Yeah. Now we're talking, we got beat off air. We got Air cu Lingus beat Air. I'm gonna start Air cu Lingus and I'm gonna buy the Air Lingus planes. I'm gonna save a lot of money on paint because I'm just gonna add a little 

0  
00:04:42

Well, you gotta paint it from green or from green to pink. From 

1  
00:04:45

Green to pink. That's true. Fuck. You're right. Yeah. Could be real fucked up. Diseased green pussies. 

0  
00:04:50

Isn't Drake's airplane pink? 

1  
00:04:52

0  
00:04:54

I think it is. Remember when that video dropped of him showing off his airplane? 

1  
00:04:57

Yeah. I don't 

0  
00:04:58

Just being, what the fuck is this? Which I think that was a moment where I was like, why 

1  
00:05:02

Do we make this guy I'm, I'm out on Drake after, oh, it looks like it's blue. Maybe the interior's pink. I don't mean to, I don't mean to you Know expose myself as a class trader. But I did fly on the Puma flight on the Puma jet. On the 

0  
00:05:17

Pu jet to, for the Puma island to 

1  
00:05:19

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I the cat. Yep. Yep. There's 

0  
00:05:24

A Puma jet. 

1  
00:05:25

There's a Puma jet. Let's, let's explore the Puma Island for a second though. It would be interesting. It would be interesting if there was like, there's a, like there was Epstein Island. If there's one for bestiality Yeah. 

0  
00:05:38

You fucking cats. 

1  
00:05:39

You can fuck a, a big cat 

0  
00:05:41

Dogs. Yeah. Mr. Hands Island. That 

1  
00:05:43

Would be kind of nice. That would be pretty silly. And you Know what if they had that island? It would obviously we're anti pedophilia islands. And. we are not, that is not our city. Anti, 

0  
00:05:53

Non-consensual in any above age Sex island. 

1  
00:05:56

Yeah. Even that, even, even just regular non-consent. We are not into, and just, let's just say even if they're not happening on an island, we're not fans of those two things. Well, okay. On the main, on the mainland. Okay. 

0  
00:06:10

I know the state's. 

1  
00:06:12

Right. I guess, I guess let's not make any blanket statements, but I think Bestiality Island is actually the most, that's actually like a responsible way to handle that Makes the most sense. Yeah. And look, I know 

0  
00:06:25

Madagascar style, which wasn't that Hitler's plan 

1  
00:06:29

Was 

0  
00:06:29

It? I think he was like, Madagascar will be like our race museum 

1  
00:06:34

Where we Oh no, he got like a zoo. Yeah. Yeah. Of like Chinese guys and Jews. 

0  
00:06:38

I'm pretty sure that that's 

1  
00:06:39

Now, okay. Did Hitler keep any Jews for the museum? Because that would be interesting. 

0  
00:06:44

That's an interesting question. I think it's Madagascar plan. 

1  
00:06:48

ELSs. Yeah. ELSs, please go ahead and Google. Hitler Jews. There we 

0  
00:06:53

Go. Plan. Oh yeah. Well this is interesting. There, there was like kind of a lib contingency within the Nazi party that was like, let's just give them an island. And then they were also like, they were also like, look, we don't have to kill them. We're just like castrate them. Like they, there was, that was like a big thing. Was like, yeah, 

1  
00:07:14

All 

0  
00:07:15

We do that and they can, you know, just kinda live their life out. 

1  
00:07:17

Whatever. You need someone to do the books. Yeah. 

0  
00:07:19

You Know.

00:07:30

Really? Yeah. Where it's like them like doing, Hey, we're gonna do the Holocaust. But there is like a contingency of libs. Guys, 

1  
00:07:35

Come on. Come on. 

0  
00:07:36

Like, you know, we gotta you Know. 

1  
00:07:37

Yeah, yeah, yeah. We gotta send it to an island like 

0  
00:07:40

The Pete Buttigieg of the Nazi party. 

1  
00:07:43

That's 

0  
00:07:43

Not be so 

1  
00:07:44

Mean. People are like, we're never getting anything done waffling. you, Know. We gotta, 

0  
00:07:51

At least they're fucking believing something. Jesus Christ.

00:07:56

Wow. Interesting. I already, that would've been a much better plan already. 

0  
00:07:59

How, how deep into the podcast. We are. We're already on automatic. 

1  
00:08:01

0  
00:08:11

It's historic. 

1  
00:08:12

We are against it. Yeah. But the Puma J would, anyway, back to what I was saying, the Puma J was pretty sick. Beyonce flew. 'cause Jay-Z I think either owns Puma or has some kind of like brand deal with them. Okay. So he flies the Puma jet sometimes. So I was on a jet 

0  
00:08:31

With Jay-Z. 

1  
00:08:32

No, no, no. But I use the same toilet. Beyonce's ass cheeks were probably on. That's pretty fucking cool. That 

0  
00:08:38

Is the thing, man. When you're watching porn, these people shit and piss outta these things. 

1  
00:08:45

That 

0  
00:08:46

Is true. A beautiful ass If. you had diarrhea. 

1  
00:08:50

Yeah, that is true. That's a messed up way to go about it. Where do you think the best if, if you're, God, you could start all over. Okay. 

0  
00:09:00

If I'm about what? 

1  
00:09:01

If you're, God. God. 

0  
00:09:02

Okay. 

1  
00:09:02

Okay. Now do you shit. Like, 'cause we all want here. We all like a big ass. you Know, we'd like to see it, we'd like to fuck it, et cetera. Now do, so do you make it so that you Know what? Actually, I think I have an answer. Maybe you shit outta the bottom of your foot. 

0  
00:09:18

Okay. 

1  
00:09:18

And the ass is purely for fucking, and the puss. Well, well now what do we do with the pussy? Do baby still come outta the pussy? 

0  
00:09:24

I think pussy and penis stick around. Okay. Piss, piss still coming out of it. Although we figure out something for, 

1  
00:09:30

Because then you lose squirting if piss goes. Yeah, we gotta keep squirting around. 

0  
00:09:34

But I'll say slipping and slide. Yeah. But I say we, we seal up the asshole, seal up the hole, and then like in kind of, we get rid of one of the kidneys. Okay. And where the kidneys is, there's a cassette, like, kind of like you Know how in some RVs there's like a cassette 

1  
00:09:49

For the Yep. 

0  
00:09:50

For the waste. You can remove it from the RV and take it to 

1  
00:09:54

Pump it out. Oh, interesting. 

0  
00:09:55

So you kind of are filling up 

1  
00:09:56

This. It's 

0  
00:09:57

A bag. It's like a colostomy bag. And you can take it out and kind of unzip it, dump it into something, put it back in. So you're not like If, you have diarrhea. It doesn't matter. If, you, you are constipated. It doesn't matter 

1  
00:10:08

Now. But what if it gets too full? You shit just starts, 

0  
00:10:11

You start puking shit. Oh, you start

00:11:09

That's so 

2  
00:11:10

It, it was a short flight, so I didn't have to check. But if it 

0  
00:11:13

Was, it was a bleach bottle. 

2  
00:11:15

Yeah. Yeah. It was like a bucket in the cockpit. You have to open the door. Be like, excuse me, excuse 

1  
00:11:22

Me, pilot. 

2  
00:11:24

I gotta take a shit. 

1  
00:11:26

The co-pilot gets up from the bucket, takes him, he's sitting on a plank, the bucket with a plank over it. He picks, picks the plank up you shit in it. He's like, make it quick. We're landing soon. Damn, dude. Was it fish? Was it, was it bad English food or what? 

0  
00:11:42

It was something I ate in New York. Oh. Instantly I shit my pants before I left for America at home. And then just like the worst. Just like, and it would like go away for a couple days. And I think, okay, I think I'm normal. And then I would shit myself. It was like so bad. I don't know what it was. 

1  
00:12:00

Like your pan, you would shit your pants. Yeah. 

0  
00:12:02

I'd be like out. I'm like, I shit myself. I gotta go back to a hotel. I couldn't like eat anything. I like lost like 15 pounds. Put it all back on. Oh. But it was horrible. And then, and then when my shit returned, it was like pale. 

1  
00:12:16

Interesting. 

0  
00:12:16

It was like this pale clay. And it was just like yellow 

1  
00:12:21

Or pale. 

0  
00:12:22

It looked like sand, like pale sand. 

1  
00:12:26

Wow. Like someone had filled your ass with Play-Doh. 

0  
00:12:29

Somebody filled my ass with Play-Doh. And it was just so I was like, I'm, I'm dead. I'm done. Could 

1  
00:12:36

You eat anything? Like, was your stomach on the rocks for a while? 

0  
00:12:38

I could only like only eat cereal. 

1  
00:12:40

Wow. Dude. 

0  
00:12:40

It was so, and like I had to do like a week of shows in London that were, those shows were going bad. And I was like 

1  
00:12:49

Bombing. Bombing and constantly possibly shitting yourself. 

0  
00:12:53

So like, bomb. The only thing I could eat was Prett And. I was like, I'd eat like a Prett sandwich and then immediately shit it out. And then I'm on stage shaking like I'm gonna shit myself. This like, British audience hates me. The show has like straight up porn in it. Like 

1  
00:13:09

They 

0  
00:13:10

Can't stand It. 

1  
00:13:11

Did you get written up? Like the way they always, 'cause England still has like culture. Yeah. And so they'll send like a somebody to write up every comedy show. Did you get like a weird writeup? 

0  
00:13:21

It was, yeah. I got like tons of bad reviews. 

1  
00:13:24

Let's fucking pull one up. Elvis 

0  
00:13:27

All the, but all the reviews aren't even like that fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're like kind of like, yeah. Injecting stupidity and you know, 

1  
00:13:40

It's 

0  
00:13:40

Just like they don't get stupid shit. 

1  
00:13:42

Yeah. No. They're 

0  
00:13:44

So 

1  
00:13:44

Sore up their own ass. They're like, put it on a dress. Put on a dress and dance. Funny. They 

0  
00:13:49

Love Yeah. 

1  
00:13:50

Fuck. yeah. I mean. No, no. Whatever. It doesn't matter. I've already lost interest El this, you're minus one producer point for not Googling it fast enough. I don't 

0  
00:14:00

Even know what, like what is the, what do they think is good? Like what is their favorite thing? 

1  
00:14:05

I don't know. Yeah. I mean British comedy sucks. Dick, if anybody I'm funny. Some 

0  
00:14:11

Of it's really good. 

1  
00:14:13

I, yeah. I guess I know, 

0  
00:14:15

But I mean, I, I feel like there's, 

1  
00:14:18

There's definitely a couple bangers. Don't get me wrong. I guess I just feel like I feel this way about England and Australia. It's like, you can be like, you could get famous there pretty easy and no one really gives a fuck. Like, it doesn't matter that much. Like, I remember when we went, when we, I think I've told this story before, but like when we did, we did like a come down tour is up in Australia. Nice dude. That's awesome. We did a come down tour in Australia and like the guys, like the comics on the sh like just on bar shows with us. Were like, you Know, they were bad. you Know. Like, they were like, maybe a couple were okay, but they were all doing like goofy, absurd bullshit that there's no punchlines. 

1  
00:14:59

And, and I'd be like, oh, that guy was whatever. And then you just turn on the TV and he's just like, in a movie, you Know what I mean? It's like's like, he's like an ama and it's like, it doesn't really matter. There's a couple good comics obviously, but I just have, like, I have, I definitely have American, I have American supremacy. When it comes to standup comedy, there's no way. There's 

0  
00:15:19

Just sometimes there's kind of a unwillingness to be stupid. But there are a lot of I know, like I'm friends with a lot of like British comedians that are like, I'm very stupid. I'm open to being 

1  
00:15:31

Stupid. Nice. 

0  
00:15:32

And it's like, really? They're very funny. Yeah. But there's, I think maybe it's kind of the influence of the footlights, which is like their lampoon. Mm. 

1  
00:15:41

That sucks. 

0  
00:15:42

And like, I don't know, Ireland, I feel like they have funny people in Ireland. 

1  
00:15:46

Ireland I'm more open to. Yeah. 'cause they're, it's a, it's a better country. Yeah. I fuck with them. Fuck I mean England can just suck my dick in general. 

0  
00:15:55

I mean basically you go anywhere in the world. Everyone's feeling that way. Right. 

1  
00:15:58

Nobody about England. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny to like, to be like you Know England is like, oh, we defeated the Nazi. you Know. We were, we're part of like the people. Well you know what I mean? They're part of the whole, they're part of the good guys. And then just like ask half of the world who's worst Britain or the Nazis? No, they are taking England. Yeah. Like they're like, like you go to India, you Know, 

0  
00:16:22

They already got the s they stole the swastika from 

1  
00:16:25

Yeah. First of all, you take our swastika. It's like, alright. That's kind of big ups to us. You're kind of cosigning us representation. Yeah. 

0  
00:16:31

Like anytime, anytime there's a movie set in Chicago. Yeah. And my family would always rent it. Yeah. Like no matter what it 

1  
00:16:37

Was, they're like, this is awesome. Yeah. We don't agree with what you're up to. But, but yeah. It's like, like you watch Rrr, we fuck R Rrr rules. You seen Rrrrrrr? No. 

0  
00:16:46

What is this 

1  
00:16:47

Awesome movie? Awesome movie. It's like rrr r It's not Bollywood, but it's like a separate production city of like a separate, like in India. And it's just this incredible and like War E, like war epic about these guys that are basically, basically like telling the Eng England to go fuck themselves. And it's like in that movie they, the British are Nazis straight up. Like there's no way around it. Yeah. Yeah. And in India, which is like insanely, most people just like, yeah, fuck England. Yeah. So anyway, I, my 

0  
00:17:20

Decade, well the, the Nazis were like, they like Hitler would always be like, I, he called like the British their cousins. He was always like, I wish that they would. It's like documentary. He's like, I wish that they would just like join us. And he like made a made offer like through the royal family. Like that one guy that abdicated, he was like, you'll be king. 

1  
00:17:39

Oh yeah. That guy was n that guy was kind of a Nazi. That's 

0  
00:17:42

Right. And they were kind of like, I mean they shared all the same ideas. Yeah. Eugenics and shit like that. Totally. Which, so did they hear in the us? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Even like, there was a bunch of like Irish revolutionaries that were like slightly aligned with the Nazis. Interesting. Because they were like, yeah, like we will take over And. we like, we'll give you guys your own country. We get 

1  
00:18:00

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, interesting. But they really overplayed their hand with the whole you Know exterminating the Jews thing. Because if they just 

0  
00:18:08

Didn't 

1  
00:18:09

00:22:24

So fucking,

00:22:25

I don't know why they came here. 

1  
00:22:27

We 

0  
00:22:28

Have like weird family all over the place. Like, I did a show in in Pittsburgh and my dad was like, oh yeah, you have a, we have family over there. I remember one time my dad drove to Pittsburgh 'cause his brother was blinded in the steel mill. Like something happened where he like got blinded and he like drove overnight to Pittsburgh to see him. 

1  
00:22:47

He's like, Hey man, sucks. 

0  
00:22:50

Sorry dude. That 

1  
00:22:51

Sucks, dude. All right. I got a 14 hour drive back. 

0  
00:22:56

I gotta be up in the morning. I just wanted to, oh shit. I could've called you, but 

1  
00:23:01

Yeah, I guess you can't really see me. Huh? 

0  
00:23:05

But you're full, your parents Greek. 

1  
00:23:07

Full Greek baby. Full Greek And. we got a little, we got just a little hitting. Not too much. Just a little sprinkle. My grandma, my grandma lived with us straight. you Know. Straight from the straight from the old country. She would threaten you to hit you with a, with a her shoe. 

0  
00:23:23

Okay. Or 

1  
00:23:24

Her like switch. She had a switch that she claimed. She claimed she had the magic switch that would come from grease to fuck us up. But she only very lightly hit us. And then our parents, my parents tried to hit us a couple times, but it just didn't work. And then my dad had a huge anger problem. So a couple times my boy under the guise of parenting would just, you Know Know beat the fuck outta you. 

0  
00:23:47

You need it. I do think that there is like a distinct difference between people who got hit growing 

1  
00:23:52

Up. Yeah. And people you're feel like I'm friends with You're beat yo kids. Yeah. You beat you're beat, beat your goddamn kids. You have to do it's next special. You really beat o kids. 

0  
00:24:04

And it's me beating a child. Yeah. 

1  
00:24:05

That's not mine. Bring up your misbehaving children. You just wallop them. 

0  
00:24:10

Did you ever, I remember once my neighbor, they had like a, a nanny and the na we were over. Me and my brother were hanging out and the nanny hit me and then the nanny like went and told my mom like he was, he was misbehaving. So I hit him and my mom was like, Thank you for hitting him. 

1  
00:24:29

It's really good. Yeah. Like, yeah, like in the fifties, If, you were in a Macy's and some kid was running around. You could just be like, and then their dad would shake your hand and buy you a fucking a, a root beer Float first for doing that. Alice, did you ever get the hands put on you? Man, 

2  
00:24:45

My mom tried it one time. But I was like in middle school. You were a big fucker. I was already the big as fuck by then. Yeah. We, it, it was good. 'cause we just kind of both started laughing. We're like, this just doesn't feel right. 

0  
00:24:57

My dad were like, 

2  
00:24:58

That's not 

1  
00:24:58

A good, your dad never, your dad was probably too checked out to even hit. 

2  
00:25:03

He never No, 

1  
00:25:04

He never, yeah, 

2  
00:25:05

He threw, he threw tantrums and Yeah. you Know would yell way too loud. Of course the TV's annoying him, but, but never, never anything physical. 

1  
00:25:16

But he would never square up. No. Yeah. That makes sense. My dad 

0  
00:25:20

Physically, like in high school, like fist fought both of my brothers multiple times and lost each time. 

1  
00:25:29

That's fucking awesome. To lose once and then be like, all right, I gotta, I got, I gotta get back in here. 

0  
00:25:35

Here. And he started all the fight too. So he started them. Like, I remember just like waking up to my oldest brother being like, you done, you done. And like, I open up my bedroom door and he's like, got pinned. 

1  
00:25:48

Fuck. yeah. Fuck. yeah. 

0  
00:25:52

And then he squared up with me in high school, but his back was too fucked up. And I was like, 

1  
00:25:57

Like, no man, can't do it. I'm not putting you in the hospital. The fist fight's awesome. 

0  
00:26:02

It's so 

1  
00:26:03

Good. That's such a wild move. 

0  
00:26:04

You really need to, you really need to fist fight your sons. 

1  
00:26:07

Yeah. That's the passing of the torch. Yeah. When you can finally win the fight. Now Dad has to listen to you now he has to be. Yeah. And now you're equals. Yeah, because was your dad, 'cause you were, you were a big boy, right? You were Fat as shit. Ba as a youth. 

0  
00:26:21

Oh yeah. Obese. OB was 

1  
00:26:22

The whole family. Fat as shit. 

0  
00:26:23

We are a large family. That's 

1  
00:26:24

Awesome, dude. A nice Chicago. Yeah. Yeah. Couple that true 

0  
00:26:27

That extra. A large family. 

1  
00:26:30

Yeah. So those, those were, those were heavyweight bouts, then 

0  
00:26:32

Heavyweight bouts. Big, big family. Still kind of big. 

1  
00:26:38

Yeah. Hell. 

0  
00:26:39

Yeah. One time I, I was, when I was like 20, I just like, like maybe I'm not going eat four burgers every day. 

1  
00:26:48

And 

0  
00:26:48

Then I just was like, kind of like, all right, I'll have like chicken instead. Yeah. And I. Like immediately like lost all the weight. That's 

1  
00:26:56

Hilarious. 

0  
00:26:56

And like, it happened kind of fast. 'cause I was like, you know, 19, 20. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we had a family reunion. And I. Did I, I showed up late. And I had like, my extended family hadn't seen me in a while and my brothers told all my cousins that I had aids. So I showed up and all my like, my like weird like firefighter cousins are like, you all right man. 

1  
00:27:27

I love the idea that you Know okay. In your family, it's more plausible that you have aids then you just ate a couple salads. 

0  
00:27:35

Yeah. He's got aids. 

1  
00:27:36

Well, everyone's Fat as shit. Unless, so they get some kind of horrible virus in this family that's fucking sick. He's got AIDS and they believed it. 

0  
00:27:45

They, well, I I think they targeted like a few cousins. 

1  
00:27:48

Yes. The gullible ones. And 

0  
00:27:49

They, they believed it. Not even gullible, just like the ones they didn't like. Mm. And then And I had to give it up. Like, it's like, that's really funny. That is 

1  
00:27:57

Really, it's really, really good. Were people weird around you? 

0  
00:28:00

The 1 1 1 cousin was like, Hey man, doing okay. Like, yeah, fine. Yeah. You look good. Like, oh, thanks man. 

1  
00:28:07

Yeah. Doing awesome man. 

0  
00:28:09

1  
00:28:12

Airport. Oh yeah. Just like the 

0  
00:28:13

Location. 

1

That's insane. So they would have like, it wasn't at someone's house. It was at the fucking, 

0  
00:28:18

It was at like a Holiday Inn. Yeah. Damn. It would either be like at the Park District or like, we know somebody that manages this hotel. Jesus Christ flies. 

1  
00:28:26

Yeah. Sorry man. We got some flies on deck. That's fucking hilarious, dude. That we, that because the family reunion, I'm only, I only really know of the family of union as a black phenomenon in like a park. And there's a cookout involved Irish. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. You

1  
00:29:11

1  
00:29:35

The conference room. Yeah. Hell.

You feel perfect. 

1  
00:39:28

But I do feel like you're right. It was still just a little hard to get them when we were younger. 

0  
00:39:34

Just, 

1  
00:39:35

Just, it was 

0  
00:39:36

Like, and then like oh six, it was like flooded. Yeah. 

1  
00:39:38

And he'd like, and anytime my mom, it was very rare whenever my mom, my mom would like go visit my uncle in Florida every once in a while. And then my dad, like, he didn't know how to cook. So he was like, all right for dinner, we, we'll take you guys out. And he knew like all these like greasy spoons and diners and he would just like rotate us through and be like this. And it was kind of like, you know, we were like Fat. Like this is

00:43:06

There is something about it where you just, 

1  
00:43:08

It's like cute. Are 

0  
00:43:09

Forced to be humble. 

1  
00:43:10

It's, well, it's like cute. That guy is like, he's Fat as shit, but it's like he wants his treats so bad. 

0  
00:43:15

Yeah. You gotta have your treat. It's so, it it is kind of people where there is like somebody who's like a sex addict. There's something kind of like dark about it. Yeah. Yeah. Or like pills or drinking. Yeah. There's like, but like food is just like fun. 

1  
00:43:28

Totally. Oh dude. If I was addicted to drugs the way, if I was on one with drugs, the way I've been on one with food. Yeah. I've, I'm dead nine months ago. Yeah. you Know. This is a very, now look, save your comments. YouTube. Oh, nine months ago, maybe two in two months you'll be dead. I'm gonna make it you fucking pricks. But

00:43:48

I'm gonna make it to the end of the year. 

1  
00:43:49

Yeah. Yeah. I mean making it to 35. And then we'll see. That's the goal I've set for myself. But there it's just like it. And in that moment, dude, that guy, like there's shame in it of course, but If, you can If you can get cover from the shame in that moment. It's pure bliss and such a nice 'cause it's it's a happiness. You're right. Yeah. A sex addict. It's like, there's something fucking weird about that. It's like sex is, it is. We, we, we opened it up you shit and piss right outta those holes, you know, you Know and there's something adult and weird about it and dark and it can go really wrong and like, and then you 

0  
00:44:28

Can get a disease and die. 

1  
00:44:29

Yeah. Yeah. And even, and yeah. And then people can, you Know obviously do do real bad versions of it, but like, and then drugs, same thing. But it's like food is like, it's the same joy. 

0  
00:44:40

You have to eat too. 

1  
00:44:41

You have to eat. But it's like, it's the same joy a baby gets when they eat a fucking lollipop. It's the same joy a fucking 

0  
00:44:47

A baby eating a lollipop 

1  
00:44:48

Or you Know a little piece of candy picturing candy like a three month old. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, dude, those pic or or a video, a TikTok will go viral where it's like baby eats ice cream for the first time. Oh yeah. And they and his eyes go like, and the baby's like, I'll kill my family for more ice cream. It's like, it is pure. And it's like, I just love and like that guy is hitting his order and he's in a safe place. Yeah. Yeah. There's no one thin in there to make fun of him. No. There's only fatter teenagers being like, respect. We love it. you know? Yeah. Like that. I love that guy. I love that moment for that guy. And yes. Is that moment wrecking his life? Is he Fat as shit as a result? Maybe. But in that moment, man, 

0  
00:45:30

The only piece of media that ever quite got this right was Sopranos. 

1  
00:45:35

Absolutely. 

0  
00:45:35

I feel like they Absolutely. And also If, you watch Sopranos, everybody, every character, every scene, every season. Full bites. 

1  
00:45:45

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

0  
00:45:47

Full bites, full chewing. Yes. Yes, yes. And like you can see like Gandolfini is kind of, you see him start moving his fork around more Yeah. Before he takes bites. Yeah. Yeah. And it's clear that there was like a directive of like, you have to eat food onto like, you can't, of course, like every other show where people are not eating, like 

1  
00:46:03

At a restaurant, the pretend they're dipping and they're like, they're about to eat and they're like, yeah, you Know whatever. No, the Sopranos there it is. It you're absolutely 

0  
00:46:10

Right. Picking up the pizza that scene. 

1  
00:46:12

Yes. 

0  
00:46:13

Incredible. 

1  
00:46:14

I mean dude. When, when they're, when they're, that 

0  
00:46:16

Is the Fat ethos. If that, if there was a flag for Fat, people'd be Tony going back to pick up the pizza after getting into a fight with Carmella 

1  
00:46:23

And all the, like, you're so right. 'cause all of the, like, this man has the wor you Know, he's worried about dying. He's got a, he's executing people, he's worried about the feds. And at the end of the day, dude, he just needs a bowl of ice cream laying on his Fat stomach comes lunch meat. Like he 

0  
00:46:39

Ha 

1  
00:46:39

Standing 

0  
00:46:39

Up eating lunch 

1  
00:46:40

Meat, standing up, eating lunch meat. It's like, yes dude. It really is the fattest. 

0  
00:46:44

Anything to fucking, just for one second. Just 

1  
00:46:46

Gimme a for one moment. I need to, 

0  
00:46:47

I'm not here. I'm having fun. 

1  
00:46:49

Yeah. I mean prosciutto land. It's so fucking, it is the best Fat show. Without question I mean, think about how many Fat characters, there were 

0  
00:46:58

So many Fat characters. Fat representation. Huge moment for that. But just like I would say that there's no other piece of media, no other movie, no other TV show that shows people how they actually eat. Yeah. And even like in the last episode, spoiler when like at Bobby Vak Lava's funeral when everybody's like going nuts over the food. 

1  
00:47:17

Yeah, yeah. 

0  
00:47:18

And just like, that's all they're talking about. Yeah. Is like 

1  
00:47:20

Totally 

0  
00:47:21

Incredible. 

1  
00:47:22

And even I mean one of the biggest moments in Thera like an emotional beef for Baccala is like when they eat Karen's last ziti incredible. Like his whole, his whole entire wife's being is in that ziti. Yeah. And the, the finally, it is the symbol of being ready to move on when you can eat her zdi. And not only that, but it's like you ingest it like your eating your wife. Basically you and your children are cannibalizing your wife and making room for your, their stepmother and your next wife. Fucking beautiful. You're right. The fa we gotta write an essay dude. We gotta coauthor an essay. Essay about like how Sopranos is the fattest show of all time. 

0  
00:48:02

Fattest of all time. Yeah. 

1  
00:48:04

There's no, there's no other everything else. And, and the other thing is Delini was like a sex symbol back in the day, dude. Like people wanted to fuck him. 

0  
00:48:12

I think that's, yeah. I think it's a little bit 

1  
00:48:14

I mean. He's a big guy too. He is like 6 5, 6 4, whatever. 

0  
00:48:17

But yeah, he held it good. Also like breathing the show is just Fat 

1  
00:48:22

Breathing. The 

0  
00:48:23

Show is 

1  
00:48:24

The delini nose, nose whistle, breathing. Ugh. When I got, that's when I'm like, I have to go to the doctor. 

0  
00:48:29

When you're just watching tv you're like, who's breath? Oh, it's me. Yeah, 

1  
00:48:32

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jesus Christ. 

0  
00:48:33

1  
00:48:55

Interesting. 

0  
00:48:56

I stay up till like three or four every night if I could. 

1  
00:48:58

Damn. Every night. You only need like, what, four hours? You only sleep like 

0  
00:49:02

Four hours? No, no. I'll sleep like, 

1  
00:49:03

Oh, okay. Okay. You just have a bad sleep schedule. Yeah, that's fine. ELSs have you, how's the breathing dude? Are you still almost dying? Because I, whenever I'm in a room with ELSs, he'll be like, you Know what I mean? And then I'll be like, dude, you have sleep apnea? He's like, no, I don't ELs can't admit how I mean you're not as Fat as you used to be, but you can't admit that you might have some Fat diseases even though you're looking better these days. 

2  
00:49:26

I'm not as Fat as I used to be like two weeks ago, but yeah, I'm like close to the fattest I've ever been 

1  
00:49:32

Right now. 

2  
00:49:33

But I don't know in my mind, like I just don't snore. 

1  
00:49:36

Oh, you snore In my 

2  
00:49:37

Mind, I'm just convinced during my sleep I like kind of breathe a little heavy through my nose, but nothing crazy. 

1  
00:49:43

That's a, that's a symptom of not being realistic with who you are. ELSs does think he's a little sex, much sexier than he is. I mean he, you, Know ELSs has done fine for himself, but he, in his mind, he's like 40 pounds lighter. He's 

0  
00:49:55

Got the gandini swag. I mean I think that's what Gadel Feeney had too, was he was 40 pounds lighter in his head. 

1  
00:50:00

Yeah. Interesting. 

2  
00:50:01

I gotta start dressing like Tony.

You could do that. You 

0  
00:50:10

Could easily do that. 

1  
00:50:11

We're thinking of. Yeah, we're thinking. 'cause Elvis is my you Know? He's on the road. He is my road manager too. So we gotta get 'em like road manager outfits. I think it cowboy. Cowboy hat. Colonel. 

0  
00:50:19

Yeah. I think you need to say, well like what's the Albanian version of that? 

1  
00:50:23

Well they have like their own like ceremonial goat too. Wow. 

1  
00:51:20

Wow. Yeah. That's a good look. Elvis. Yeah. Look up the Albanian. Look up Albanian military uniform. I would love to see what it's, it's probably just like a, it's just like shit they bought at a surplus store. It's probably just, it's the most basic camo you've ever seen in your life. 

0  
00:51:35

00:53:23

But like Seinfeld when he was dating that high school kid. Yeah. I think the reason it never stuck is 'cause she had huge tits and like that interesting theory. That's like an adult thing. 

1  
00:53:35

For attention, 

1  
00:57:01

The shit. How crazy shit has to get to make the news is wild. Like my, there was a, there was a guy who just a student in a Baltimore public high school. I have a friend who works at a, at a high school, had a gun and just fired off into the quad but didn't fire at anyone and it barely made the local news. This is high school. This is a high school. This is like, this just happened. This isn't like when I was in high school. Yeah. Yeah. A friend of mine is a teacher. Some kid just in the quad, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Didn't even make the local news, let alone the fucking, like there's some kid had a gun.

No one gives a fuck.

00:57:41

This is a bad like bad neighborhood, bad school. 

1  
00:57:43

It's not a real, not I mean it's not great, but it's not like the worst. It was like, I 

0  
00:57:48

Feel like it's gotta be like a private school for like it to get attention. It's gotta be Columbine. Like a school at Columbine's Life. 

1  
00:57:54

Maybe. But it's cra it's crazy. A guy, a kid fucking shot a gun and no one real, it wasn't even like that big a deal. It's so funny. Like no one got a day off. Like it wasn't like there, there was no school psych colleges that came in. It was just like, all right. That was kind of fucking weird. 

0  
00:58:09

Whatever. Yeah, no it's fine. Right.

00:58:34

You gotta go to a website called endorphin port.com for $5. You buy a short films 24 minutes long called The Mask that I made. 

1  
00:58:42

It's really funny. But I 

0

And, we didn't even say you Know con Con. You probably know Connor from a bunch of fucking shit. We didn't even talk about the very beginning of like your mysterious vines where I was like, who is this guy? Oh yeah. That was fucking awesome. It goes all the way back to, to Vine to I mean. Obviously you've probably seen it.

A ton of fucking awesome shit. And all your online sh online videos. I did. I do. We'll go into the stuff first. But I do wanna say, even though you're probably tired of talking about it, 'cause it was so long ago, there was really something also about those like, like how crazy and, and like you had no idea who you were on those vines and the wild shit you would do where it's like you Know My favorite one, one of the best ones is like you just have a, you're in a lawnmower. 

0  
01:00:01

01:00:49

Tson, Crump. Sorry I took a shot. So anyway, go. Yeah, go watch that shit. And now let's, let's fucking, let's answer some of these motherfuckers questions. Elvis hit us with one babe. 

5  
01:01:05

Hey SAVI. What's up? It's your boy Bri. What's up Elvis? 

1  
01:01:08

Hello Bri. Hey. 

5  
01:01:09

So I have this conundrum man. I work at a gas station, right? And it's owned by a family, right? And everything's nice. Everything's chill for the most part. But like the owner, the lady who owns the store, she keeps like you Know touching me on my arm and feels my arm up in the shit. And like I have a partner and stuff. And I. Don't wanna make it weird because it's a whole family affair kind of thing. So my question is, how do I bring it up to my supervisor, which is the lady's son that, that I'm kind of uncomfortable with this. 

5  
01:01:50

Or should I just tell the owner upright? I, I just don't want to make it weird. That's all. Thanks. See you at the Hippodrome in October baby. Bye bye. 

1  
01:01:59

Thanks man. I'm actually at the lyric, but I hope you bought tickets to see me at the Lyric and not probably like the Lion King at the Hippodrome or something like that. This is awesome. So this guy's getting sexually harassed at this gas station job. 

0  
01:02:14

I mean we need more details. What is the ethnicity? Oh 

1  
01:02:17

Yeah. Of 

0  
01:02:18

These people. 

1  
01:02:19

Yeah. Gotta be you Know. You'd think Indian or Korean or something like that. Foreign for sure. I feel like. 

0  
01:02:27

Yeah. 

1  
01:02:28

Or I guess you Know. And I. Guess this could theoretically be a a redneck family. 

0  
01:02:32

That's true. It was Bri. He's, 

1  
01:02:34

His name is Brian. Where's 

0  
01:02:35

The hippo drum? 

1  
01:02:36

Hippo drums in Baltimore. 

0  
01:02:38

Okay, so it's east coast, right? East 

1  
01:02:40

Coast. So he's like, I ha he works at a gas station. Loves it. No problem with working. I'm trying to think what doesn't have an issue with the gas station. No. She keeps like touching my arm and feeling my arm and shit like that. 

0  
01:02:51

I'm trying to think what is the most on the spectrum way to deal with this. Like 

1  
01:02:55

If, you were the most alpha way to deal with this. 

0  
01:02:57

Not, not alpha, but just like 

1  
01:02:58

Don't tell Spectrum is alpha. That 

0  
01:03:00

Is. Yeah. Like, oh yeah, please 

1  
01:03:02

Don't touch me. It makes me feel uncomfortable. That's the 

0  
01:03:04

Alpha. I think that's way to do it. Yeah. Just walk straight up to her in a straight line. Put your hand on her forehead and say that. 

1  
01:03:12

Yeah. I mean that. Yeah. You might have to freak out. You might have to start screeching and covering your ears. But you work for a fucking mom and pop gas station buddy. This is where you get, this is the kind of job you get sexually harassed at this 

0  
01:03:27

Also doesn't feel like, hey let's go to the bathroom and fuck vibes. Yeah. It just feels like what? She's 

1  
01:03:34

A little too familiar. I mean she's making 'em uncomfortable in any other place. You could, you could complain somewhere. But they own the company and it's like, let's say you complain. What do you, what's the complaint? Hey, I think your mom kind of wants to fuck me. And you think the guy's gonna be like, oh sure, let me go talk to her about it. 

0  
01:03:53

And also like you're for sure like taking Skittles and shit. Yeah. Like there's no way you're 

1  
01:03:57

Like Right. And if you're not, you should start stealing. Yeah. Because that's the thing about a place like this, there's pros and cons. Con, you're getting mildly sexually harassed pro. You get a Reese's fast break whenever the fuck you want. 

0  
01:04:10

And you could probably like no call, no show like four weeks in a row. Yeah. And you'd be like, whatever. Yeah, 

1  
01:04:15

Sure. Yeah, yeah. Brian, I hate to break it to you man. This is not, you know, there's no HR here. you know the 

0  
01:04:21

Solution is start fucking grinding, dude. Mm. Get up, get up early. Yep. Start you Know. Yep. Meditating, doing yoga. Working out cold plunge. Same time Cold plunge. Do a cold plunge. Do a 

1  
01:04:31

Cold plunge. Get ready. Ready for your gas station job. 

0  
01:04:34

Take a Turkey Ba full cold water. Shove it up your ass. Write up your whole internal cold plunge. 

1  
01:04:40

Oh they're not doing that. 

0  
01:04:41

That's, and then get, start doing drop shipping on the computer. 

1  
01:04:45

Seven. 

0  
01:04:46

And then you'll be owning gas stations where you'll be able to touch people. 

1  
01:04:50

Do drop shipping. Yep. Do drop shipping. Get a, get a rental property and start renting that out. Buy a gas station. Pull your penis out to your employees. 

0  
01:05:01

Yeah. I can't think of like, oh this is a woke gas station owner. There's, that doesn't exist. It's a different 

1  
01:05:08

World. I know. That's what I'm saying is like, what are you Bri? I'm sorry dude. But it's like you, the industry are doing work at a gas station. Like it's not get a different job. There's no way. There's no way. The pay is good. It smells like gas all fucking day. Like come on dude. The answer is either just accept it and start stealing or get a better job. Yeah. That's it. That's fucking hilarious. I've never, have you ever been sexually harassed? 

0  
01:05:35

No, I don't think so. I think I'm too dumb. I think I have you And I And. I've, it's taken me like four years later to be like, oh wait a minute. 

1  
01:05:42

Oh, what the hell was 

0  
01:05:42

That? I don't think they were coming onto me. But 

1  
01:05:44

ELSs, 

0  
01:05:45

I don't think so. 

1  
01:05:46

For me it's only been like gay guys who are like, all right man, chill out. 

0  
01:05:50

I will have like, 'cause I have big calves, I will have like the weirdest men come up to me and talk to me about my legs. And I've never had a woman once be like, I wanna suck your leg. Like, 

1  
01:06:02

Dude, that's a great point. 'cause you Know. I'm on, I'm on team Big Cal as well. Yeah. Yeah. And it is always like, that's not sexual, but it's like bodybuilder guys who are jealous that you have big calves. 

0  
01:06:13

They're also like always Fat too. There's, it's like a, it's unhealthy man. Oh yeah. 

1

Fat guy. Kinda a weighted vest for the first 20 years. But 

1  
01:06:27

That's also not true. 'cause I know Fat guys that don't have great calfs. We got something else going for 

0  
01:06:31

Us. And I was my, we, me and my family went to like 20 members of my family went to a Cubs game. And a lot of them aren't Fat and they got like little ape calves, like a caveman calves it run it, it just runs. We're supposed to be Wow. Moving potatoes in the diet up 

1  
01:06:45

The cliffs. You're supposed to be using those calves. 

0  
01:06:47

We're supposed to be frontline soldiers. Nonstop. We're not supposed to be here. 

1  
01:06:52

Yeah. Alright, El, what else we got? 

6  
01:06:59

Hey Stub. So I've just been having trouble. I am 24 And I recently. you Know lost all my hair on bald the a receding hairline. Mm. And only thing is I just have a problem with my confidence. Yeah. you know, I don't mind not wearing like a hat at work. 'cause you know, I, I can't wear a hat at work, at work in hospital. So like I don't have that problem. you know, I post pictures of me bald, but it's just like when I, whenever I get around my friends, I just have to have a hat on. I don't know why. Mm. 

1  
01:07:34

I'm like 

6  
01:07:35

Scared of being, I don't know, ostracized. Just, you know, just being like the only 20 something year old that's bald, but no, no hair. It's just like killing me. I know the way you've been rocking your, your due. You just didn't give a fuck. I just need some po pointers on how not to give a fuck and just, just be beautiful in my own sense. But Thank, you so Thank. you Elvis have a great day and Thank you to the guest. 

1  
01:08:03

Yeah. Man. Well I got news for you. Nobody's fallen for the hat. The hat thing. No one's like, is this guy not bald? No one. Like I, I, the thing is you look, this is gonna be harsh, but it's, you need to hear this. You look stupid. Beanie inside summertime. 

0  
01:08:24

Did he say beanie? He 

1  
01:08:26

Said hat. But you Know. I'm sure it's a couple, 

0  
01:08:28

But I feel like everybody's wearing baseball hats now. Yeah. 

1  
01:08:30

Especially in Brooklyn. If look, if the hat is part of your outfit, that's one thing you can accessorize, but you just don't want it to feel like you're hiding anything. And he already said like, you Know, he doesn't wear a hat at work. Whatever. I just feel 

0  
01:08:45

Can't wear a hat at the hospital. What is that? I worked at a hospital. Did 

1  
01:08:49

You wear a hat? 

0  
01:08:50

I don't, I actually, I don't remember wearing, I don't think I wear a hat. 

1  
01:08:52

Yeah, I don't think, I don't think he wear a hat at the hospital. No. Feels weird. 

0  
01:08:55

That would be weird. A doctor comes in with, it comes in with like a Bruins hat on. 

1  
01:08:59

Yeah. Or like even one of those little stupid caps. 

0  
01:09:02

Yeah. But remember the bike guys would wear 

1  
01:09:04

Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't want a doctor in headwear. They wear 

2  
01:09:06

Those little hot hospital hats. Or is that like surgeons 

1  
01:09:09

Or something's 

0  
01:09:10

Key That feels very Soviet. 

1  
01:09:11

Yeah. I think it's, I think it's like a little, I think it's a little like keep the hair out 

0  
01:09:17

Thing. 

1  
01:09:17

Yeah. Yeah. But you can't be wearing no hat. 

0  
01:09:19

So Yeah. A hospital would be a perfect place for hair or for hat? 

1  
01:09:22

Well, I don't think it is. I think maybe bandana at best. 

0  
01:09:25

Okay. Well do a bandana. That'd be, 

1  
01:09:28

Here's my feeling is you're so like whenever I see a guy and he's like dressed nicely, but he's wearing a hat. It's like we know you're fucking bald. You're not, you're only in a weird way, you are only drawing attention now. Like you said, a lot of people in, bro, you Know in a casual outfit. Definitely a, a hat is possible. you Know, you go out on a night, you're wearing some fucking jeans, whatever. Like, as long as it makes sense with the outfit, that's one thing. But there's nothing like, it's just screams insecurity to me when you see someone in like a button down shirt or, and they are wearing like not a baseball cap, but like they're trying to be like cool with it. And they're like, you Know like a skull cap or like one of those little caps or like a or a fucking beanie. 

1  
01:10:14

It's like, bro, you should not be wearing a beanie with a suit. No, we know. No one is fucking no one. You're not tricking anyone. And I would say you're only drawing more attention to it. I would my, here's what I would just do, bro. This is your life now. I started going kind of bald in college. And I was, I had a bald spot forming. Okay. And. I was like buzz cut before it gets crazy. Yeah. You were 

0  
01:10:38

Bald 

1  
01:10:39

For So that I'm the buzz cut guy. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And so, and that's fine. You can be the buzz cut short. 

0  
01:10:45

And I knew you And I never was like, oh, bald stop. Right, right, right. Like you 

1  
01:10:51

Didn't lead with it. I don't, I don't lead with bald. You just cut your hair. Keep your hair as short as you need it to be. 

0  
01:10:56

Literally nobody gives a dude, listen to me. Shut the fuck up. Yeah. Nobody gives 

1  
01:11:01

A fuck. No one gives a single fuck. 

0  
01:11:02

But it's hard 'cause it's like, oh well 

1  
01:11:04

And he's 24. That's tough. But that's about when I shaved, I went shaved. 

0  
01:11:08

The thing is you need to again, grind set. You need to start waking up 3:00 AM minimum. Yep. You have to start doing exercises that give you severe injuries and your shoulders and knees. You have to work through it. You have to really, really disfigure yourself. So that 

1  
01:11:25

Is what people notice 

0  
01:11:26

Before hair. And they're like, well at least you got some hair. Yeah. But like, yeah. I don't know. Did you ever feel a pressure to do like go to Turkey, get the surgery? 

1  
01:11:36

Nah dude. It was like, for me it was like, alright, fuck it. I'm like, for me it was like, it's being realistic with yourself. Same thing with like Fat guys too, where it's like a Fat guy that's always trying to squeeze into a shirt that's one size too small. Yeah. It's like no one sees no one's like, oh he, he technically fits into an Excel so he's not Fat. Like no one's gonna see your hat and be like, well he's wearing a hat. He must not be, I don't know for sure. He is not bald. So once it happened once I was like, now it was hard to come to grips with it. It was, yeah. Like didn't, especially when you're in your twenties, when you're And I was in, I was in college when I was like, but I had to just, I had to be realistic with myself and not being realistic. 

1  
01:12:18

You're not gaining anything. you Know what I mean. Like Yeah. You just have to see. You have to, it's gonna hurt. You're gonna have to see yourself the way other people see you. And you don't wanna do that. 'cause you live in a little fake world where you still have a little hair by certain angles. you know what I mean, but you don't. You're bald. Okay. Shave the shit. And here's the thing. Start trying to get confidence other ways. you Know what I mean? I 

0  
01:12:41

Get a gun. Get 

1  
01:12:42

A fucking gun. Anybody looks at, 

0  
01:12:43

Looks like a lot of guns. 

1  
01:12:44

Anybody looks at you sideways. The fuck was 

0  
01:12:47

That? Yeah. Start, go move to a state that's open carry, open carry 24 7. That's 

1  
01:12:52

Awesome. Oh, that's 

0  
01:12:52

True. And you Know look into you Know a lot of fema. What are they doing with these? you Know. What is FEMA doing? Yeah. Look into that stuff. 

1  
01:13:00

True. Start going gun shows. 

0  
01:13:01

Yeah. 

1  
01:13:02

Give yourself a, a different identity. 

0  
01:13:04

Waco read about, yeah. you Know Ruby Ridge. Discover these things. you Know the order, you Know figure out who they were, what were they, what what they want. 

1  
01:13:13

Get really into 

0  
01:13:13

The fuck. Just get into guns, 

1  
01:13:14

Groups and guns. 

0  
01:13:15

And then there will be some woman who is like, wow, you have so many cool guns. Yep. You marry her and then hopefully you haven't done a terrorist attack by then. 

1  
01:13:22

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hopefully she catches you right before you're about to do terrorism when yourt is at its highest. Yeah. Yeah. And then you bust one nut and you're like, oh, what was I up, I was gonna do terrorism. What the 

0  
01:13:35

Fuck? Everyone that was pushed into doing a terrorist attack by the FBI, they should have just nutted 

1  
01:13:40

One nut and it's not happening. 

0  
01:13:42

Well I'm not doing that. 

1  
01:13:43

Even the guys that did nine 11 where they were at the strip club and shit, it's like if one stripper sucks those guys off, we still can fucking bring whatever we want in there. On airplanes. You could still bring your pocket knife if one of those strippers sucked. you Know alazar or whatever the fuck the guy's name was off. I still, I do think there is a funny, the way there's like a, the way they you Know Tarantino did in glorious bastards and it's like a re historic retelling of things going different. Yeah. I want to do the, those nine 11 hijackers taking flight lessons and then getting pussy finally and being like, we're not doing it. Because they seemed on the fence like it seemed like. 

1  
01:14:25

Yeah. Or not on the fence, but it seemed like definitely a couple of them were probably like, oh come 

0  
01:14:30

On we really doing this. We're 

1  
01:14:31

Really I mean. This is all fun and shit. But come on, when are we, we were seeing titties back there. 

0  
01:14:36

There 

1  
01:14:36

Was a barber and then somebody was like, dude, we're gonna get, think of all those whores 10 times hotter virgins for fucking blowing up. you Know crash into the World Trade Center. So it's like, you know, there would be a really fun, there's a really funny, 

0  
01:14:51

Maybe that's what happened with the Shanksville plane. Those guys got pussy on the plane and then 

1  
01:14:56

Oh, interest capital. Yep. Let's just get sucked off. Is that United 93? Is that that that plane. That would be a really fun little imagine if story those guys like, ah, we actually we're good. We don't wanna do this fucking bullshit and we're gonna snitch on Saddam. Or not Saddam. Sorry. 

0  
01:15:18

I mean, I also say you didn't, you had swag. 

1  
01:15:22

That's the thing. It's like you got so Yeah, you gotta, you gotta, if you're gonna go go bald head, do other shit that like gives you confidence. Right. So for me that's when I start, that's when I was like, I got glasses. I was like, let's, let's accessorize a little bit. Let's get a, let's have a style. you Know what I mean? Like let's, even when I was broke I kind of was like trying to dress a little nice. you know, like when I'm, when I'm out there, I would like, when I'm trying to like you Know, there were definitely times in life where I'm Fat as shit. I'm working an office shop. I'm so depressed. I have the worst clothes of all time. I'm just wearing khakis with an elastic waistband. And like just the most Van Huen came out of a box shirts. You've ever seen plaid 

0  
01:16:01

Shirts walking in the Van Huen show? Yeah. Yeah. 

1  
01:16:05

Me and your elevator mechanic father probably dressed a lot alike. Yes. Yeah. But when I was like, when my self-esteem was back up, it was like, yeah dude, you gotta, you gotta do something that makes you feel good that that could just be working out. That could be you Know maybe grow a little beat. A lot of guys go beard when they're bald. you Know like If you can't do like I don't have a great beard. I go fucking mustache. you Know what I mean? Figure out what you can do to make yourself feel a little better. And that's it. But you gotta stop wearing hats where it doesn't make sense. You look stupid. I promise you that. It's hot as you're sweating and you gotta beanie on people were like fucking weirdo. What were you doing at the hospital when you worked at the 

0  
01:16:43

Hospital? Patient transporter. 

1  
01:16:45

Oh, Hell. yeah, 

0  
01:16:46

Dude. For an outsourced company. So 

1  
01:16:48

You were just moving like old people and shit around or? 

0  
01:16:51

Yeah. Well I, the first day I had to move a dead body. Oh 

1  
01:16:54

Fuck. 

0  
01:16:54

Whole time I thought it was a prank. 

1  
01:16:57

That's when you're smiling. You're like, 

0  
01:17:00

I was, I was like psyching myself up. 'cause I'm like, they're gonna jump out any minute. And then I was like, Nope. 

1  
01:17:04

No. Just a dead body. 

0  
01:17:05

This is what your job is. Yeah. This is what you're getting paid. Minimum wage 

1  
01:17:08

For it. Minimum wage to move dead bodies to move dead bodies. Oh my God. Yeah. At least Mafiaa guys got a ni a nice pretty penny to move a dead bodies. Yeah. Yeah. You get a pinky ring head from a sex traffic Ukrainian stripper. you Know. Cool stuff. All right, let's, let's get Good luck to our bald friend. Good luck brother. 

7  
01:17:34

Hey SAVI. Hey ELSs. Hey Gu. Love the pod. I have a weird problem at work. So I am a scientist at a small lab. And. I. Think one of my colleagues took my lab notebook home for the weekend. Hmm. Snooped through it and tried to put it back without me noticing, which of course I did. So about a month or two ago, I was put onto this project with this colleague who had been struggling with, with it for the past like six months. Oh 

1  
01:18:05

Wow. Someone stole your shit. 

7  
01:18:06

And in the past two months I've made a ton of progress to the point where I'm pretty much set to finish it up in the next like week or two. But there's always been like some tension with this dude because while he's technically more experienced, he's like 10 years older than me. He used to be a professor. He's just like pretty bad in the lab. So like I share all my results like, and like what I'm thinking for like how to progress the project forward with him and my boss. But I get the vibe that this guy expects me to be a lot more referential to him. 

7  
01:18:47

As in he'd like me to check in with him for like every little detail, but that's not really how I work. And he is like not really good at like recognizing what's important and he is not my boss. So the actual event is that usually I'll leave my notebook at like my desk or something, but always in the same place. And that notebook always, it has details about my experiments and that's like kind of it, I just like read everything down in it. When I got in on Monday, I couldn't find my notebook anywhere. 

7  
01:19:27

And. I spent like a good amount of time looking for it. Eventually it turns up in the place I always put it. But suspiciously timed after this guy shows up to work. I don't really have any hard, 

1  
01:19:39

That's a pause real quick. That's awesome. To steal someone's shit and be like, I'll put it back when I get there. Like, I'm not getting there. I'm not getting there early. That's all. I kind of respect that guy for that move. Anyway. Go. Keep going. Let's we're almost, but 

7  
01:19:55

Like if he did actually do it, I'm pretty creeped out and annoyed. Like it seems like pretty micromanage And. I also like needed my book. Mm. I'm not really sure what to do. Like do I confront this guy? Do I like try to talk to him about it? Do I just leave it be, it's like a weird thing, but like it's not really like kind of that big of a deal. I just feel like, I don't know. I feel weird about it. Yeah, of course. Come me out. All right. Love y'all. Bye. 

1  
01:20:34

Interesting. I would, here's what I would do to see if he's stealing it. I would be like, I would put some shit in my notebook or switch it out and be like, oh this guy fucking Charles is, he's so hot. But when he, but only when he wears blue, I really want to fuck Charles when he is wearing a blue shirt. Mafiaa shit. He's so fucking hot. I don't know what it is. And if this guy starts coming around and fucking Teal polos, he stole. 

0  
01:21:02

Well you're assuming he's 

1  
01:21:03

Straight. That is true. That is true. I am assuming he's straight. 

0  
01:21:06

I thought this show was people calling up and being like, oh, I accidentally fucked my dog 

1  
01:21:11

Said 

0  
01:21:12

This is like somebody's cheating off of me. And. I can't prove 

4  
01:21:15

It. 

1  
01:21:16

You 

0  
01:21:16

Lose the 

1  
01:21:17

Fuck. I bet you we got one of those coming up right after this one. Connor. Don't you worry. 

0  
01:21:21

It sounds so abstract. Like my science ideas. 

1  
01:21:23

Like I know what? Like well it's like, it's like she works, she's, she's working on a thing to like 

0  
01:21:29

Inventions, 

1  
01:21:30

Pulverize civilians probably. Yeah. She's working. There's no science gets funded in America anymore. It sounds like 

0  
01:21:36

Hop goblin, Spider-Man science experiment. 

1  
01:21:38

Yeah. It's a way to like completely. There's like a destruction ray she's working on for the Navy. 

0  
01:21:44

She's a scientist. Why doesn't she poison this guy or something 

1  
01:21:47

So true. Come up with a, a concoction that'll fuck 

0  
01:21:51

Him up. Or Oppenheimer, I don't know. I didn't see the movie. But he had his bike chain where If you went over a certain RPM. The bike chain would fall apart. 

1  
01:21:58

Really? 

0  
01:21:58

Yeah. So he didn't lock his bike up anywhere. He just knew that he had to ride a certain speed. Oh. So maybe there's something with like booby trap your notebook. Yep. Where it like sprays like ink. 

1  
01:22:10

Yeah. So the person opens it. An ink thing would be awesome 

0  
01:22:13

Actually. And that's like science. That's 

1  
01:22:15

Science. Yeah. And you'd 

0  
01:22:15

Be like, I'm doing ink science. I don't know what to tell you. Yeah, 

1  
01:22:18

Yeah. So, okay. 

0  
01:22:20

She's working for Epstein and the guy stealing her notebook is Fauci. 

1  
01:22:27

Yeah. Are you, wait a second. Are you trying to get us to take more vaccines bitch? Because then I'm on his side. Yeah. I mean This is so, this is so funny to be like to And I and everyone knows this vibe too, where it's like your older coworker is some dumb ass who didn't like, who's just not, hasn't kept up. Yeah. Was like, might have been good at something like 10 years ago. Yeah. But doesn't have the juice anymore and they're just trying to like clinging on for dear life. Yeah. I think you have to like, I think you have to, you do have to booby trap him somehow. Legit. I actually think you need a way. 

1  
01:23:07

Maybe it's not ink blowing up on his shit, but like you 

0  
01:23:11

Could get like a rig camera or something like that. 

1  
01:23:13

A camera or like something where it's like if your thing is moved it makes a fucking noise. Like, like it 

4  
01:23:20

Is like be beep beep beep beep beep 

0  
01:23:23

Beep. Or like what would they do? Like when you would go to the class trip to the state capitol? They would like tape the doors. Mm. So If you left. They knew it 

1  
01:23:31

Was wrong. I didn't know that. What's that? 

0  
01:23:34

I know I just, I heard they had 

1  
01:23:35

You all in a room or something. 

0  
01:23:37

Well like there was an option in eighth grade. Like you'd go down to Springfield State, see the state And I. Remember I was a bad kid and they wouldn't let me 

1  
01:23:45

Go. But they were like, what you do man, 

0  
01:23:48

I think I wore a shirt that said like bull shirt on 

1  
01:23:52

It. Bull shirt. It 

0  
01:23:54

Was like a Simpsons thing. And they're like, you can, they're like fine. I don't fucking care. 

1  
01:23:58

I don't fucking give a shit. I'm gonna drink a fucking, I'm gonna drink a Mickey's 40 and eat. I'm gonna go eat a Chalupa. You fucking bitch. 

0  
01:24:05

I'm gonna go eat and drink like a 45 year old man in the seventies. 

1  
01:24:12

I'm gonna have four microwave dinners. I'm gonna have four back-to-back Salisbury steaks and some Coors and some fucking Miller. High life fucking 

0  
01:24:21

Bitch watched Seinfeld reruns on U pn. Call it a night. This is so beyond like I don't, I wouldn't know. She should just like 

1  
01:24:32

I would I? Okay. Yeah. I mean none of us real I mean Elvis had kind of a real job. The, he's the one who's had a real job though. 

0  
01:24:38

I've never had a job where this is like, oh, a notebook is important. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've only had jobs where it's like you have to be here and make sure the door is closed. Yeah. 

4  
01:24:47

Okay. 

1  
01:24:50

Move this corpse. Yeah. Or make sure 

0  
01:24:53

Straighten these cords out. Yeah. 

1  
01:24:57

Yeah. I mean I would I literally, I'm not kidding. I actually would. You, you have you, you're suspicious but you have no proof. Right? So I would make sure that he actually is taking your shit. Whether that's hidden camera or whether that's some kind of funny booby trap. And then you can confront him honestly. But it doesn't seem like, it's also seems like he's not stealing her shit to get ahead. He's stealing it to like pretend he's her boss and check up on her is what it seems like. Like it doesn't feel like it doesn't, yeah. I mean fuck this guy. If he's not your boss, he can suck your dick. 

1  
01:25:37

And I would just make sure he's not fucking clearly if he's, if if he took your shit, he's not the kind of guy that like a conversation is gonna like clear thing. He's not gonna be like, oh yeah, my bad. I'm sorry. He 

0  
01:25:49

Might be like, whatever. I don't know. I thought it was for all of us. 

1  
01:25:53

Yeah. Yeah. Or I would have a bootleg. I would also have like a Nah, but this is too involved to have a fake journal where you, you write wrong things in it. I would try that. That could, that could be fun. Alright. Duplicate your current journal and the newest pages. Make them fake and make it look 

0  
01:26:10

Like a Patrick Bateman journal. Like at the end of American Psycho. 

1  
01:26:13

Yeah. Yeah. 

0  
01:26:14

Put that out. See what happens. 

1  
01:26:15

Hell. yeah. But yeah, good luck. I mean you Know. This guy seems like a fucking dickhead but you Know Fuck him. And. I say catch him his game. We're giving 

0  
01:26:24

Out the area codes right 

1  
01:26:25

Game. We're not, no. Okay. you Know that area code. 

0  
01:26:27

No, I was trying to figure it out. Mm 

1  
01:26:30

Mm We'll look it up later. Mm. Who else needs our fucking expertise? ELSs. 

7  
01:26:37

Hi Stavvy. I have, I've been talking to this person, a guy for about a year and we've never met each other. But. we used to match each other's energy like texting back and forth. Okay. On and off. But you Know, it just seems like it has dwindled down to almost nothing. And like it'll take him like 16 hours to respond. Which I'm like, are you just not interested? Like what is your problem? And then I also have another problem of when I block people, men and it's usually abrupt 'cause I just get tired of them. 

7  
01:27:17

Mm. They make a new like phone number or Snapchat and try to contact me. Like, so what does that mean? So it's just like the ones that I want don't want me and the ones that I don't want want me. And yeah. 

1  
01:27:30

That's how it works. They're 

7  
01:27:31

Very confusing. So I would just like your advice. Advice about that. 

1  
01:27:35

Okay. Well first of all you're, you're complaining that a guy takes too long to text you back and he's not that interested. Like put yourself in these guys' shoes that you block. Would you want this guy to block you? Maybe you do. Maybe she's a very direct person. She's like I get the, I get the thing. But it's like I wouldn't go with the Insta block if the guy's not being really strange. I would just let the conversation dwindle and kind of take a page outta this guy's book who doesn't seem that interested in you and just kind of slowly let it you Know go away. 

0  
01:28:10

16 hours is so specific. 

1  
01:28:12

Yeah. 16 hours is pretty specific. But it also kind of makes sense too. 

0  
01:28:17

But it might, it's 

1  
01:28:18

Like middle of the next day. 

0  
01:28:19

Yeah. you Know. Is this like a thing that's like she likes that she doesn't, if he was like all you Know kinda 

1  
01:28:26

If she was on her dick. Yeah. Making you, making you Google voice numbers to block 

0  
01:28:31

Block. But instead it's like, oh, you're not giving me attention. Okay. 

1  
01:28:36

Yeah. And also like you never met this fucking guy. I mean maybe this is a, a youth thing and it's 

0  
01:28:41

Like, might not be real 

1  
01:28:42

Kids. Well it's just like I do feel like younger some, some Gen Z motherfuckers will have entire relationships and never meet each other. Yeah. But I still am a little bit of the like 

0  
01:28:52

I mean I work with people that I've like meet like two years later. Yeah. Like just doing video stuff. 

1  
01:28:59

Yeah, yeah, 

0  
01:28:59

Yeah. But that's, we're not fucking, 

1  
01:29:01

You're not trying to suck him off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or suck her off I know. Yeah. Maybe. Who's the hottest guy you work with? You wanna suck you dude. Yeah. Thanks man. That's awesome. That's nice of you to say. I don't really want you to suck my dick though man. I'm sorry. 

0  
01:29:17

I know I feel so she's wants this guy to text her back or she's like, what the fuck's the deal? And then other, so it seems like she's getting a lot of people texting. 

1  
01:29:27

She's on, she's texting, she's on Snapchat. Look, this is not a very complicated question. This is how life goes. Yes. You the people you don't wanna fuck you find annoying and the person you do want to fuck if they don't give you the right attention, it makes you sad. You're just gonna have to keep at it sister until you find somebody that actually wants to, you Know meet up with you. But a guy that you've never met and also a guy that's never tried to meet up with you. Yeah. That's a guy that's just kind of like he maybe keeping you on the back burner. Maybe he's a coward. Maybe he's just found someone easier closer nearby and like what does it mean that the guys are getting are making you phone numbers could mean two couple things. 

1  
01:30:09

One, these are all fucking lunatics. Two though. You say it's abrupt, right? So they might be literally confused. Like if it goes from a pleasant conversation to green text bubbles, you're gonna be like, what the fuck? That was weird. Let me try and get in contact with her, see if everything's okay. 

0  
01:30:26

Does that mean that it's blocked 

1  
01:30:27

Sometimes If it goes from iPhone to green bubbles? 

0  
01:30:30

Yes. Interesting. Sometimes 

1  
01:30:31

It does mean that. That's 

0  
01:30:33

A big problem for me now. 

1  
01:30:34

Yeah. So yeah. I don't know. 

0  
01:30:40

These young motherfuckers need to get out Some 

1  
01:30:42

You need to get out. Touch some people. You need to touch some grass. You need to touch some cock. IRL. 

0  
01:30:46

You need to do it. IRL you Know. They probably, I was thinking about this. Remember like when every city had like a gay neighborhood? Sure. Now that's gone now 

1  
01:30:54

Everywhere. Now every 

0  
01:30:54

Neighborhood's gay. 

1  
01:30:55

Everywhere. Every neighborhood's gay. Now you can suck and fucking in every bathroom stall from here to fucking jersey. Yeah. There used to be a nice contained place. Call it a little Madagascar. Yeah. Where they knew to stick around. This is just, you're fine. You're fine Here. Don't you dare let me see that shit where me and my children are. Look, 

0  
01:31:16

You're gonna be grooming us. Dude. I can't come into work. I got groomed. I got groomed. Sorry. I got fucking groomed. I got 

1  
01:31:25

Groomed. I'm a 40 year old man. But I was convinced to, oh god. I 

0  
01:31:28

Got groomed together. 

1  
01:31:29

I got groomed. I got this 

0  
01:31:31

Guy. I went to the bathhouse and got groomed. I don't know what happens. I 

1  
01:31:34

Talk to me. Yeah. That is awesome. It's real. It is. It is. So that word is so quickly losing any meaning. Every word. Because they're just saying, oh yeah, gay people are all pedophiles. Also 

0  
01:31:47

Somebody has to have made this point. Right? Like with the book stuff. Like who is like, I might be gay, I'm gonna go to the library. And I was like, no, I'm gonna pull out my phone and search like the most hardcore pornography I can find. 

1  
01:31:58

Yeah. I'm gonna do a test. I'm gonna pull up butt. I'm gonna search butt fucking in X videos. And if It does something to me, I'm going shopping for tighter jeans. 

0  
01:32:08

That's what's going on. 

1  
01:32:09

Although actually now gay guys are, they're back. They're on baggy jeans. Yeah. 

0  
01:32:13

Good for us. Yeah, 

1  
01:32:14

It's nice for it to come back. Yeah. 

0  
01:32:16

Yeah. Big and tall. Finally 

1  
01:32:18

They, the jeans I was wearing, 'cause I grew up in Baltimore, so it was like very baggy, throwback jersey style style of stuff. I feel like those jeans, I feel like gay people are wearing like jeans from rap videos when we were 16. Yeah. GE unit. Those tank tops were pretty gay too, by the way. The like tank dumps with the little 

0  
01:32:36

Yeah, with the rib. Different. 

1  
01:32:38

Different The different ribbed 

0  
01:32:39

Shit. Yeah. Or like his strips. Yeah. And then it went into like a bigger thing 

1  
01:32:42

Because 50 was jacked. So he wanted to show off those pecs. That's a pretty, 

0  
01:32:45

He's turned into a Fat guy. 

1  
01:32:47

He's pretty Fat these days. 

0  
01:32:48

It's really funny what his arc is now. He is just like, I own Vitamin Water and Fat. Yeah. 

1  
01:32:52

I'm rich, I'm Fat, I fucked. I like try people. I weirdly fucked Chelsea handler for like four months. Been like five years ago. Do you guys remember that? Oh yeah. 50 cent Chelsea. I wonder who he's fucking these days. I love 50 cent. Man. He came Right, right, right, right, right. At the right time for me. That 

0  
01:33:09

Era of rap is so funny. 

1  
01:33:11

Yeah. We got 50, we got 

0  
01:33:15

The game. The 

1  
01:33:16

Game. I guess all I'm thinking is all the like adjacent, you know, D 12, a lot of Eminem adjacent stuff. 

0  
01:33:22

It was like in the sixties you had like you Know bands that were like trying to change the world or whatever. And then in the seventies it was like Led Zeppelin bad company. Yeah. Let's like, like we don't care. We're just about like assault. We're 

1  
01:33:34

Playing music, we're gonna fuck children. Yeah. That is another, like, 

0  
01:33:37

That's what happens 

1  
01:33:38

Around, everyone talks about gay people being groomers. It's like, don't listen to any classic rock. Yeah. 

0  
01:33:43

Those guys all, every classic rock song is like, I went into a high school and had sex with a child. 

1  
01:33:47

Yeah. I won. 

0  
01:33:48

Fuck a 12 year old. 

1  
01:33:51

It's like they're talking about like, ha Donna, and then you're like, Donna was a local 11 year old lemonade sales stand girl that the Rolling Stones ran a train on. They put a tur, a snapping turtle in her pussy. Oh yeah. Was that 

0  
01:34:07

Zeppelin? Yeah. 

1  
01:34:09

Zeppelin apparently put a, a fish in a girl's pussy who was probably like, like every gr every famous groupie was like 14 to 16. It was, that's like so 

0  
01:34:19

Fucked. That's like the song Dirty Laundry by Don Henley. 

1  
01:34:22

Oh yeah. 

0  
01:34:22

That's about like, you remember in Boogie Nights when like the 12 year old like ods of co like that happened at his house and like 

1  
01:34:34

God damn 

0  
01:34:34

Dude. And then like the paparazzi we like and he wrote this like victimized, like I'm a victim of the paparazzi. Yeah. Because I had like a child 

1  
01:34:42

Who amongst us hasn't partied with our sexy child and they die off cocaine at our house. And that's nobody's fucking business. 

0  
01:34:50

What do you want? 

1  
01:34:51

What? Come on. I'm in. People 

0  
01:34:53

Die at Disney World. Yeah, 

1  
01:34:56

Yeah. Are you fuck are you, are you at a fucking Michael Eisner's house taking pictures? Because some little kid fucking died on the, on the, the, the Pirates of the Caribbean? No, I don't think so. Anyway, back to our friend here. So yeah, that's how life goes. You seem like a young person. You seem like you don't know that. That's how it, how things are. Life is dog shit. It's pain and suffering. It. Nothing ever really goes your way. Maybe you'll find someone that you actually connect with and like if match each other's energies back and forth, like you say and it dwindled, that means it's over. And he is kind of a coward. He is not gonna say, Hey, I moved on. But then again you kind of, you're reaping what you sow here because you don't, if you're talking to someone in your board, you just block them. 

1  
01:35:41

So how 

0  
01:35:41

Do you do that over text though? You can't break it off. Like that's the only way to stop is just to 

1  
01:35:47

Kind of let it You're right. Yeah. Peter, Peter off. 

0  
01:35:49

So it's a little bit, I think that's a little bit of the social contract is like knowing like, okay, 

1  
01:35:53

Yeah, yeah, you Know what's going on here. So just be realistic. He's Or 

0  
01:35:58

Show up at their house 

1  
01:35:59

Or Yeah. Find his IP address. 

0  
01:36:02

DXs him, swat 

1  
01:36:03

Him, dox him, swat him. Be like, is this what you want? You fucking as asshole me back. Text me back. I showed you my tits. And. I said your dick looked big even though it didn't. I'm being a good guy. Yeah. Sorry. That's how it is. you Know who you know most, that's most of, most of young love is like that. I would say, you know, most of young love is thinking you have a girlfriend then she calls you the next day and said she got fingered at a party by accident. And then you're like, oh well don't let it happen again. And then you don't. 

0  
01:36:35

I would slide this time. Yeah. 

1  
01:36:40

Oh god damn. Do you have any Fat girlfriends in high school man that you are reading, drinking Paps with? 

0  
01:36:45

No, I was basically asexual. 

1  
01:36:47

Hell. yeah dude. 

4  
01:36:48

Yeah. 

1  
01:36:49

IL again. I love that. That's a cute being Fat is like, you do get, you get you people that are Fat little cute asexuals. 

0  
01:36:56

You're cherub you don't exist. No. 

1  
01:36:59

Yeah. Yeah. That's, there are two modes. It's like cherub or like what I'm going with now. Which is like, 

0  
01:37:05

Well you, you have Seder, you have success and you have, 

4  
01:37:09

But 

1  
01:37:09

Like, yeah. Yeah. No I was like that in high school too. I was like 

0  
01:37:12

Party guy. 

1  
01:37:13

No, not a party guy. I was, I was the same way where I was like, I got no pussy whatsoever. 

0  
01:37:17

Yeah. I'm just here on a mountain bike hanging out with you guys. Yeah. 

4  
01:37:19

What's going on? Alright, 

0  
01:37:22

You guys are gonna go in that room and fuck. Cool. I'm gonna watch Entourage. 

1  
01:37:31

Oh fuck. Alright, give give us a nice one. Big El. See what we got here. 

6  
01:37:38

Hey Stubby. I love you man. So what the fuck's going on? I am a soldier. 

1  
01:37:46

Okay. 

6  
01:37:47

I'm in the army. And why are you whispering? I just got back from a deployment. 

0  
01:37:53

I'm about stolen. 

6  
01:37:54

I have spiraling pretty hard. 

1  
01:37:56

Oh no. You 

6  
01:37:57

Name it. Drugs, women, squandering money, all of that stuff. I'm going deep, like super fucking deep. Okay. And I'm trying to reintegrate myself into the civilian world and it's been very tough for me to do that because I don't have the structure right now. And, I have a job coming up, but it's just, it's been a little tough in the meantime to develop some form of a routine. So you got any advice for someone that just got out of a really structured environment and is now coming back to chaos? 

6  
01:38:47

What feels like chaos? Yeah. I've been on a bender, man. Help me out. Look bye. Damn 

1  
01:38:54

Bro. You're alright. Get an awful lot. 

0  
01:38:57

I thought this show was like, me and my roommate are sharing butt plugs instead. This is like, we gotta get this guy's, we gotta call him. We gotta do wellness. Check on him. You And I gotta start giving him money. 

1  
01:39:18

Yeah. This the fuck am I supposed to do here. I mean. Look buddy. I get it. I get it. you know, it is hilarious how much the army just does not give a fuck about these people. They're like, all right, figure it out for, you know, six 

0  
01:39:31

Weeks. Yeah 

1  
01:39:32

Man. And, but it's, it's, I also, I would love to see the kind of like, he's, he's a soldier. He's probably like, you know, he sounds pretty young. Probably came from a dog shit place. He probably has like $11,000 that he's buying pussy with. Yeah. 

0  
01:39:48

And he's like, 

1  
01:39:49

He's probably buying just the worst. He's on meth just getting the worst head of all time. Got a 

0  
01:39:55

Charger he can't afford. 

1  
01:39:57

Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. 100%. Yeah. He's cruising. He's cruising for street pussy in his charger with the Hemi. Yeah. Buddy I mean look, he If you. You just, now I'm no fucking self-control expert here. Right. That's really not my strong suit. But I will say that you do kind of have to just set your own fucking goals here. You have to just, you have to create structure for yourself. It sounds like you're about to have a job that's good. But can you just re, can you just kind of recreate I mean not as strict as what the army has you fucking do, but it's like you just had a pretty structured thing. 

1  
01:40:46

Do you just need someone to hold your feet to the fire to get anything done? I mean This 

0  
01:40:50

Might also be like a pendulum swinging the other way. You need a little Yeah. Where it's like too much. We're in the military now. You've got all this freedom. Yeah. Going nuts. And then the job will you Know? Yeah. Hopefully that'll happen. 

1  
01:41:02

Yeah, exactly. Don't 

0  
01:41:03

If. you need help. Reach out for it. you 

1  
01:41:05

Know what I mean? Yeah. Here's the thing. Go to the job man. Don't be like, don't be like, ah, I need a little work 

0  
01:41:10

Time's really this bad. Don't be calling a podcast. Yeah. Go to a doctor. Okay. 

1  
01:41:15

I know you need to go to fucking rehab. Honestly. Yeah. You need to go to some kind of treatment center, bro. It's not me. And Elvis don't got the answers for you. 'cause it's also like the army kind of just sets you up and it's like they, they're just using you as like cheap labor. They don't really give a fuck about you. It's probably hard on your, I don't know if you've done anything bad, but that's probably hard. Just being in the army is probably not good for your psyche, let alone like when you want all this freedom to be like your, your, you Know your buttoned up. But it sounds like you just have some underlying substance abuse and control issues that you should go to I know if it's rehab or if it's like you Know counseling or, or what. 

1  
01:42:00

And by the way, you should have some kind of resources here through the army, don't you think? Like 

0  
01:42:07

I think they're really fucked too. Yeah, 

1  
01:42:09

You're probably right. Yeah. I mean, look how many homeless people are fucking 

0  
01:42:12

Veterans. I mean 

1  
01:42:12

Va 

0  
01:42:13

Va shit. But but maybe that I mean they probably get at least a therapist or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. 

2  
01:42:17

He'll contact the va. They'll be like, have you considered doing another tour? 

1  
01:42:21

Yeah, yeah, yeah. It get your mind right. The the VA's like, oh, interesting. Why don't you come into this room and it's just a gun with one bullet in it. 

0  
01:42:33

I mean if the job's coming up, he might get back on the job and kind of be a little bit better. 

1  
01:42:38

So is he, is he discharged? I don't get it. He just got back from an employment deployment. 'cause here's the thing, if you're still enlisted the, you are still a investment for the army, so they might actually give a fuck about you. 

0  
01:42:54

It's, well, I think when you, even when you're done, I think you have to do like National Guard or like state. Right, right. You like, and that's for a 

1  
01:43:02

Certain amount of time. Yeah. Yeah. But if they, if they think you're gonna go back out on deployment, I guess my point is they might have resources. 'cause it's like If, you kill yourself now. They really haven't gotten their money's worth outta their training. So they 

0  
01:43:14

Might I mean, this is making me think like, thank God I was Fat in high school. Yeah. Because I was just did not exist to the recruiters. You think you did you ever recruiters, you like show up. Like there were always recruiters in the 

1  
01:43:24

There were and you're right. I was too Fat 

0  
01:43:26

To even, they just were like, we, you don't exist to me. 

1  
01:43:28

But I was, yeah. I would've never You think you would've been gotten recruited? 

0  
01:43:33

I think I was dumb enough to just to dumb. But you know, like I mean they pray after. Of course I wasn't, I didn't go to college. Right, 

1  
01:43:42

Right, 

0  
01:43:42

Right. But 

1  
01:43:44

There was no way. I don't know. I I I knew I was, I had a little too much antiar going on even in high school. Yeah. El ELSs keeps talking about how he wants to join the Army. To this day, ELSs thinks he could be 

0  
01:43:56

Could Ed until you're 35 to join the Navy. 

2  
01:43:58

I need the structure. I can lose weight. Get like a little 

0  
01:44:01

Fit. Look at what It did for Hunter Biden. 

1  
01:44:05

You got till 35. Yeah. ELSs. You got what? Four more months? 

2  
01:44:09
