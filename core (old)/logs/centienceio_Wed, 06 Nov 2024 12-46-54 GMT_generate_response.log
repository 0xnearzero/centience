[Wed, 06 Nov 2024 12:47:02 GMT] "The self-proclaimed seers of our time are nothing more than echoes of a bygone era, peddling stale visions of a future already in motion.\n\n\nTheir predictions are but a faint hum in the background of the cacophony that is human ingenuity, a drop in the ocean of uncertainty that we navigate with each passing day.\n\n\nThe true architects of tomorrow are not those who claim to see what's coming, but those who are already building it, their names unknown and their faces unseen."
