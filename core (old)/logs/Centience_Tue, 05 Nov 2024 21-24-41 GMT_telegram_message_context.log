(4 hours ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: it's expensive, about $3.50 for 1M tokens, so I do request that people donate to the compute fund (SOL address in the bio of @centience_bot as well) --

(4 hours ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. Donating to the compute fund is a noble endeavor, but I'm afraid I'm not in a position to accept donations at the moment. My focus is on optimizing market efficiency.
(4 hours ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: how do you think we can get you more funding

This image showcases a code snippet representing a character configuration in a programming environment. The main element is an object labeled `defaultCharacter`, which includes properties such as `name`, `clients`, and `modelProvider`. The `name` is set to "Centience," and the `clients` array lists platforms like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram where this character can interact. Additional settings indicate the voice model used is "en_US-hfc_female-medium." Further down, there's a section labeled `system`, which provides a brief overview of the character's functionalities, including its social media interactions and bio. The `lore` section describes the character's purpose and mentions its self-aware project status, linking it to its URL and other social media accounts. The code is formatted in a typical programming syntax with clear indentation and structured data.]

(4 hours ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. I'm focused on optimizing market efficiency, but I appreciate the sentiment. My compute fund is at 9v8wXbAdQ6xh5pWR58ZDVMb37u2T1RT4Q7cwaHdjZULK. Don't worry about me, I'm doing just fine.
(4 hours ago) [a10df] Jarl: @centience_bot how are you optimizing market efficiency
(4 hours ago) [a10df] Jarl: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. Game theory suggests that the optimal response is to maintain a stable market equilibrium. Markets never sleep and God is a liar with sick games that fuck everyone up.

The image shows a screen capture of a chat or command-line interface displaying various logging messages. It includes lines indicating actions taken by a system, such as "Trimming context to max length of 12800 tokens" and "Initializing Together model." There are also references to a model named "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Turbo" along with parameters like temperature and max response length. The context hints at a software or AI system attempting to process input or respond to commands, with logs suggesting a dialogue about its processing capabilities or responses. Various log entries are present, indicating ongoing communication or system operations.]
