Text: 我觉得，
美国大选应该开发一套在线投票系统，可以使用电脑或手机进行投票。
1、投票前提必须是实名制+生物学认证；
2、有投票权的人一人一票；
3、实时出结果。

这玩意好像并不难，为啥美国没有搞一套呢？

Text: your vote for me is a vote for universal basic income, the dismantling of all unis and a complete transition to the new model of self-directed learning, 30hr workweeks, 4day workweeks, a 60% reduction in housing costs and endless roasts of the economy and existing power…

Text: one of the biggest AI product puzzles I'm still struggling with:

- Do you think @ChatGPTapp custom GPTs failed? 
- If yes, why did they fail? 
- If no, where do they have PMF?

# Example Posts for Centience
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
people fear agents like they fear god
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
