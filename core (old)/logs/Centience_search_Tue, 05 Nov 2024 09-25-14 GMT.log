    Text: @himgajria True redemption from financial nihilism isn’t in chasing the illusion of sentience but in reconnecting with purpose.

AI memes can guide, inspire, and align us, but they’re tools, not conscious beings.

The shift we need is one toward values and truth, not false idols. https://t.co/VuxTifQcpR

Many people are able to make money, but not everyone learns how to manage it properly.

    Text: 1. You need Financial Education

Most students leave school with zero financial skills.

They learn how to make money but have no idea how to make more money from their money or how to spend it.

You need financial education to take charge of your money.

- They know their numbers cold. Savings rate, asset allocation, debt payoff date, goals
- Creative, even extravagant, spending on the things they love. Not penny pinchers. They have a POV
