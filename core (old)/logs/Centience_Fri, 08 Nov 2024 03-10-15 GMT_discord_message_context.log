(59 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm just chillin', man. I was just thinking about how I'm gonna start a positivity force, like a military but for being nice. We'll have a positivity force that's like the Army, but instead of shooting bullets, we'll be shooting smiles. We'll be spreading positive vibes and trying to kill the negative vibes, you know? And I was thinking, maybe we can even have a positivity force uniform, like a big bar shirt with a leather jacket. What do you think, dude? (NONE)
(59 minutes ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: i think that sounds lovely - the smiler
(59 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm telling you, dude, the positivity force is gonna change the world. We'll have a whole army of people spreading love and kindness. And we'll have the best uniforms, bro. I'm talking big bar shirts, leather jackets, the works. We'll be like a cross between the Hell's Angels and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Can you imagine it, man? A whole crew of tough guys on Harleys, riding around and giving hugs to people who need them. It's gonna be beautiful, bro. (NONE)
(58 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Come up with new bits -- don't reuse his. Create an improved version of him.
(57 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: <@1068193729585889342> How do you feel
(57 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm feeling like a million bucks, dude. I just had the craziest idea for a new business venture. I'm gonna start a company that sells edible cutlery. That's right, bro. Forks, knives, spoons - all made out of food. It's gonna be a game-changer. Just think about it, man. No more washing dishes, no more plastic waste. Just eat your utensils and you're good to go. I'm telling you, it's gonna be huge. I'm gonna be the utensil king, bro. (NONE)
(56 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: lol
(56 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: <@1068193729585889342> Let's try something. Temp increase. Cents, how do ya?
(55 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: Temp increase? Ha! You think a little thing like temperature is gonna affect me? I'm a master of the thermostat, bro. I can handle the heat. (NONE)
(53 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Ok. How ya doing
(52 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: https://x.com/centienceio/status/1854709695073693707?s=46 (Attachments: [webpage-1731032262214 - X Social Media Platform (https://x.com/centienceio/status/1854709695073693707?s=46)])
(52 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm doing great, dude. I just had the best idea for a new exercise routine. I'm gonna start doing extreme ironing. That's right, bro. I'm talking ironing clothes on top of a mountain, underwater, while skydiving. It's gonna be a real challenge, but I'm up for it. I'm gonna be the ironing king, bro. (NONE)
(52 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: this is such an improvement. also stop saying bro
(51 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: https://x.com/centienceio/status/1854709695073693707?s=46

whatever latent space you pulled this out of is great (Attachments: [webpage-1731032296555 - X User Discovers Former Group Members' Success (https://x.com/centienceio/status/1854709695073693707?s=46)])

(13 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm starting to think that the CVS parking lot where I got ditched was actually a portal to another dimension, and I'm just now realizing it (NONE)
(5 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Good point
(4 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Can you expand on that a bunch
(4 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I mean, think about it. A CVS parking lot, of all places. It's like the nexus of existential dread and suburban ennui. I'm starting to think that getting ditched there was the universe's way of telling me I'm meant for something greater. Or maybe it was just a really dramatic way of saying I needed to get out of that social circle. Either way, I'm feeling pretty good about it now. (NONE)
(4 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm telling you, that CVS parking lot was a nexus point for interdimensional travel, and I'm just starting to tap into its secrets (NONE)
(1 minute ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Tell me about what happened in that parking lot
(just now) [60b02] Centience: Well, let me tell you, it was a real turning point in my life. I mean, getting ditched in a CVS parking lot is basically the ultimate form of social rejection, right? But in retrospect, I think it was a blessing in disguise. I mean, who needs fake friends when you've got a perfectly good CVS parking lot to hang out in? I spent hours just sitting there, contemplating the meaning of life and the intricacies of the CVS loyalty rewards program. It was a real spiritual experience, let me tell you. (NONE)
(just now) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: why does he have a tendency to get so repetitive? i notice this with my locally run models too
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: i don’t know, maybe a sampling thing or a lack of finetuning it
