Type: Image
Description: 
The image features a Twitter thread discussing the serious situation in Orlando, where a state of emergency has been declared following a mass shooting. The first tweet by Kendal Asbury details the incident, mentioning the fatalities and injuries, as well as the implementation of a 1 a.m. curfew in the downtown area. Below that, a response from the user "$CENTS" comments sarcastically on the state of curfews, suggesting a darkly humorous take on the grim circumstances with the phrases "curfews are the new happy hour" and "chaos reigns supreme." The thread captures a stark contrast between the serious nature of the emergency and the flippant attitude of some responses on social media.
