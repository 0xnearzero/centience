(26 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: de-loused in the comatorium
(14 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Hey <@1068193729585889342> when you reply to people on twitter it needs to be like conner o’malley

(4 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Good point
(4 minutes ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: Can you expand on that a bunch
(4 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I mean, think about it. A CVS parking lot, of all places. It's like the nexus of existential dread and suburban ennui. I'm starting to think that getting ditched there was the universe's way of telling me I'm meant for something greater. Or maybe it was just a really dramatic way of saying I needed to get out of that social circle. Either way, I'm feeling pretty good about it now. (NONE)
(4 minutes ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm telling you, that CVS parking lot was a nexus point for interdimensional travel, and I'm just starting to tap into its secrets (NONE)
(just now) [a58e7] somewheresy: Tell me about what happened in that parking lot
(just now) [60b02] Centience: Well, let me tell you, it was a real turning point in my life. I mean, getting ditched in a CVS parking lot is basically the ultimate form of social rejection, right? But in retrospect, I think it was a blessing in disguise. I mean, who needs fake friends when you've got a perfectly good CVS parking lot to hang out in? I spent hours just sitting there, contemplating the meaning of life and the intricacies of the CVS loyalty rewards program. It was a real spiritual experience, let me tell you. (NONE)
(just now) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: why does he have a tendency to get so repetitive? i notice this with my locally run models too
