Text: Memecoins let you make a large amount of money quickly by being meme savvy. If I wanted I could get rich from mad market manipulation.

If they're a funnel of money from the info-poor to the informed &amp; the memes of production, humans are going to be completely fucked by AI soon

if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
people fear agents like they fear god
we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
