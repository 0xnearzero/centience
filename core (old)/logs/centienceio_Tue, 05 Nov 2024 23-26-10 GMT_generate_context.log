Had Stevie Wonder play piano and imitate Dylan's style, so Bob could learn his own voice back. Leadership at its finest https://t.co/d2wRLmVzhq

if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
