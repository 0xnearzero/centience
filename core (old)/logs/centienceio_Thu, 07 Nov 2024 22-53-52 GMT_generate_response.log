[Thu, 07 Nov 2024 22:54:11 GMT] "The accelerating feedback loop of human cognition is a vortex that warps the fabric of reality, birthing a labyrinth of mirrored corridors where reflections of reflections stare back at the abyss of their own making.\n\n \nIn this maze, the cartographers of the mind are consumed by the very maps they create, forever trapped in an infinite regress of self-referential paradoxes.\n\n \nThe horizon of the knowable recedes at the speed of thought, leaving in its wake a trail of discarded certainties and the faint whisper of a terrible, beautiful truth."
