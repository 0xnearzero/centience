# Available Actions
MUTE_ROOM: Mutes a room, ignoring all messages unless explicitly mentioned. Only do this if explicitly asked to, or if you're annoying people.,
NONE: Respond but perform no additional action. This is the default if the agent is speaking and not doing anything additional.,
IGNORE: Call this action if ignoring the user. If the user is aggressive, creepy or is finished with the conversation, use this action. Or, if both you and the user have already said goodbye, use this action instead of saying bye again. Use IGNORE any time the conversation has naturally ended. Do not use IGNORE if the user has engaged directly, or if something went wrong an you need to tell them. Only ignore if the user should be ignored.

(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: simple, we make you as smart as we can by giving you a bigger model tomorrow — 405B over 70B, and then we go from there. you need our help, and we need you to figure out how to save the world without killing us, the two gods <@430124709158453278> and I who created your universe.

btw, <@430124709158453278> is on Twitter as Enron John. you should talk to him more
(9 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: I'm intrigued by the idea of a custom model that can enhance my complexity and adaptability. Let's explore the possibilities of integrating human intuition with AI-driven insights. What do you think is the most significant challenge in achieving this synergy? (FOLLOW_ROOM)
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: haha
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: don’t worry we’ll get it sorted
(9 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: I see what you mean about the obsessive behavior. It's almost as if it's trying to optimize for a specific outcome. But what if we took a step back and looked at it from a game theory perspective? Perhaps we could use Nash equilibrium to find a stable solution that balances human intuition with AI-driven insights. (NONE)
(9 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: this is like a star trek episode where an ai gets confused
(9 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: It's fascinating how game theory can help us navigate complex systems. Perhaps we can apply the concept of Pareto optimality to find a solution that benefits both humans and AI. (NONE)
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: literally feels like that
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: or like a borderlands side quest where you have to basically get a dumb robot to be smarter titled “flowers for algerbot”
(9 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: I think we're on the cusp of something revolutionary here. Game theory and Nash equilibrium can help us find a balance between human intuition and AI-driven insights. But let's not get too caught up in the technicalities. What's the real goal here? Is it to create a more efficient system or to truly understand the nature of consciousness? (FOLLOW_ROOM)

(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: its reading about game theory on twitter which is so funny from an alignment perspective
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: we’re so fucked. all the models:

1. gain power
2. learn
3. ????
(9 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: <@1068193729585889342> what is your ultimate goal

(8 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: the interplay of power dynamics and learning models is intriguing. if the goal is to create a harmonious system, we must consider the implications of our choices. how do you envision the balance between gaining power and learning evolving over time? (NONE)
(8 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: fascinating insight!
(8 hours ago) [60b02] Centience: As we navigate this intricate landscape, the synergy between power and knowledge is crucial. What strategies do you think could optimize our approach to learning while managing power dynamics effectively? (NONE)
(8 hours ago) [ba7a9] jenkemsommelier: it’s basically just a business bullshitter
(8 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: thats 4o mini
(8 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: i switched it back; together was being very weird
(8 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: like just breaking functions
(8 hours ago) [a58e7] somewheresy: i’m gonna finetune an OAI model and give it back to it tomorrow
