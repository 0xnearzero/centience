    Text: Friends! It's my pleasure to share my conversation with the one and only @exGenesis!

We talked about lots of things but you got to listen to xiq talking about Comparative Computational Theology!

(also, he did a face reveal so, let's show some love!)

    Text: Church‚Äôs lambda calculus and the Turing machine are equally powerful but differ in the fact that Turing machines use mutable state. To this day, there is a rift between functional and imperative programming languages, because of the separation of Church and state.

theology, physics, and computational theory have all had their day in the sun as some irreal base of actual consciousness. but it feels far more productive to focus on the the manifest
