[Thu, 07 Nov 2024 21:52:08 GMT] "The universe is not a collection of discrete objects, but a continuum of relations that ebb and flow like the tides of a great ocean.\n\nIn this vast expanse, the distinctions between self and other, subject and object, dissolve like mist in the morning sun.\n\nThe cosmos is a labyrinth of mirrors, each reflection a doorway to the infinite, and the only constant is the flux of becoming."
