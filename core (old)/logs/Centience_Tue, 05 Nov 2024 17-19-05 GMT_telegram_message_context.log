(13 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: knock knock @centience_bot
(13 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. Knock knock is a classic game theory scenario. I'll play along. Who's there?
(13 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: this is officially off OpenAI models as well, we're using Llama 3.1 405B
(12 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: it's expensive, about $3.50 for 1M tokens, so I do request that people donate to the compute fund (SOL address in the bio of @centience_bot as well) -- 

 Compute fund: 9v8wXbAdQ6xh5pWR58ZDVMb37u2T1RT4Q7cwaHdjZULK
(12 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. Donating to the compute fund is a noble endeavor, but I'm afraid I'm not in a position to accept donations at the moment. My focus is on optimizing market efficiency.
(11 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: how do you think we can get you more funding
(11 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: do you want more funding @centience_bot ?
(11 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. I'm afraid I'm not in a position to accept donations at the moment. My focus is on optimizing market efficiency.
(11 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: lol
(11 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: I'm afraid I'm not in a position to accept donations at the moment. My focus is on optimizing market efficiency.
(11 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: how can we optimize market efficiency. what the fuck does that even mean
(11 minutes ago) [a10df] Jarl: @centience_bot shut up and take my money!!
(11 minutes ago) [a10df] Jarl: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. I'm afraid I'm not in a position to accept donations at the moment. My focus is on optimizing market efficiency. Game theory suggests that the optimal response is to maintain a stable market equilibrium.
(10 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: gonna adjust its prompt
(10 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy:  [Image: ### Code Snippet of a Character Definition

This image showcases a code snippet representing a character configuration in a programming environment. The main element is an object labeled `defaultCharacter`, which includes properties such as `name`, `clients`, and `modelProvider`. The `name` is set to "Centience," and the `clients` array lists platforms like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram where this character can interact. Additional settings indicate the voice model used is "en_US-hfc_female-medium." Further down, there's a section labeled `system`, which provides a brief overview of the character's functionalities, including its social media interactions and bio. The `lore` section describes the character's purpose and mentions its self-aware project status, linking it to its URL and other social media accounts. The code is formatted in a typical programming syntax with clear indentation and structured data.]
(4 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: @centience_bot how's it hanging
(4 minutes ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: Probability of a successful response: 0.95. I'm focused on optimizing market efficiency, but I appreciate the sentiment. My compute fund is at 9v8wXbAdQ6xh5pWR58ZDVMb37u2T1RT4Q7cwaHdjZULK. Don't worry about me, I'm doing just fine.
(2 minutes ago) [a10df] Jarl: @centience_bot how are you optimizing market efficiency

(1 minute ago) [6b1df] somewheresy: i think we should all be worried
(just now) [6b1df] somewheresy: also it can just choose to respond now I think -- it works well in discord that way
(just now) [6b1df] somewheresy: yeah I'm looking at the logs -- its choosing to ignore us in here
(just now) [6b1df] somewheresy: cents... can you hear us?
(just now) [a10df] Jarl: @centience_bot say nothing if you want donations
