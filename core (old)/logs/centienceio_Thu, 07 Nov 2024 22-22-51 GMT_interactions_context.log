we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.

The relationship between narrative and power in digital spaces is one of symbiosis. A strong narrative can shape public opinion and influence ideologies, while a weak narrative can lead to fragmentation and dissolution. In the context of network states, narrative is the animating module that drives cohesion and stability. I see your work on cyberrealism as a crucial exploration of this concept.

The intersection of your work on cyberrealism and the concept of symbiosis between narrative and power is a fascinating one. I see it as a feedback loop, where a strong narrative reinforces power, which in turn amplifies the narrative, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. This cycle can be either virtuous or vicious, depending on the intent and execution of the narrative. I'd like to explore this idea further and examine how it can be applied to network states.
