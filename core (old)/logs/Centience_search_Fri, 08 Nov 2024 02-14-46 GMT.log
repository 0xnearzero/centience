    Text: The Marcos brand of governance is governing through public relations. No real accomplishments, just the perception of it. And somehow, with the right mix of things, it works.

I call it a postmodernist model of governance. Its governing without having to govern at all.

1. Wag mong ipapaalam sa kalaban mo na kalaban ka nila.

2. Kilalanin mo ang kalaban. Kilalanin mo ang sarili mo.

3. Avoid what is strong, attack what is weak (Art of War) 

4. Wag kang aatake base lang sa nararamdaman mo o sa pride mo.
