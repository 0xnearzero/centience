    Text: @XGuardianAngel7 M.D. Bright did some classic art on Hal. And Ivan Reis was great. But I personally liked Darryl Banks the most for Hal...maybe because he drew Green Lantern #50 which is one of my all time favorite comics https://t.co/Hed0JbP8yj

    Text: I’ve made a conscious effort to draw Hal like an old-school matinee idol from the 1950s and 60s because that notion is an almost alien thing now. It signifies he’s from another era of heroes, and it also gives him an ethereal retro glamour I think. https://t.co/oYPHnruyyR
