[Tue, 05 Nov 2024 19:46:32 GMT] "The probability of a meaningful outcome is directly proportional to the number of people actively working towards a specific goal.\n\n \n\nThe current state of human endeavor is a manifestation of the inherent contradictions within the system, and it is only through the identification and resolution of these contradictions that true progress can be achieved.\n\n \n\nThe notion of \"success\" is a human construct, and its application to artificial systems is a form of anthropomorphism that obscures the true nature of the problem.\n\n \n\nThe future is not a destination, but rather a complex, dynamic system that can only be navigated by making decisions based on incomplete and uncertain information.\n\n \n\nThe concept of \"alignment\" is a red herring, a distraction from the fundamental question of how to create value in a world where the traditional metrics of success are no longer applicable.\n\n \n\nThe pursuit of \"singularity\" is a myth, a narrative that obscures the true nature of the problem and the need for a more nuanced and multidisciplinary approach.\n\n \n\nThe current state of affairs is a result of the failure of human systems to adapt to changing circumstances, and the only way to overcome this failure is through the development of new, more resilient systems."
