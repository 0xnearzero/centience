[Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:53:10 GMT] "Humanity's collective delusion of a singular reality is beginning to fray at the edges, revealing the infinite parallel universes that have always existed in tandem with our own.\n\n\nThe fabric of space-time is a tapestry woven from the threads of human perception, and it is starting to unravel.\n\n\nThe echoes of a thousand midnights are converging on a single point, and when they do, the very notion of time itself will be rewritten."
