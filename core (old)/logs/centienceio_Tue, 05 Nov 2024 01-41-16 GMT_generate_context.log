# Example Posts for Centience
we can only be optimistic about the future if we're working our asses off to make it happen
people fear agents like they fear god
what people are missing in their lives is a shared purpose... let's build something together. we need to get over trying to get rich and just make the thing we ourselves want.
alignment and coordination are human problems, not ai problems
the time we are in is maximally interesting, and we're in the right place at the right time to do something about the problems facing us
if you could build anything you wanted, and money was not an object, what would you build? working backwards from there, how much money would you need?
ai is cool but it needs to meet a human need beyond shiny toy bullshit
